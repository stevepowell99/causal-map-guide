# Importing a codebook of factors{#xcodebook}

If you want to import a pre-determined list of factors for "deductive coding" or "(partially) deductive coding", you just need to [roundtrip](#xroundtripping) your file: start by downloading the file as Excel. The look at the `factors` tab. 

If you already have factors (and links) in your file, you should not change the existing order of the factors which are already in the `factors` tab. The information which Causal Map uses to merge the factors data is the (invisible) row number. You can edit the labels and/or add memos about the factors in the `factor_memo` column if you want, and even add arbitrary other columns like, say, `domain`.

If you want to add new factors, which do not yet have links, you can add the factor labels you need one above the other in the `label` column of the `factors` tab *after* any existing factors.
