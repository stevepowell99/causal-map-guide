# Importing a codebook of factors

If you want to import a pre-determined list of factors for "deductive coding" or "(partially) deductive coding", you just need to [roundtrip](#xroundtripping) your file, and add the factor labels you need one above the other in the `label` column. You can also add memos about the factors in the `factor_memo` column if you want.
