# ðŸ“š Factor labels: actor-focused{#xfactor-labels-actors}



Often you will find that it is easier and clearer if you formulate your labels to highlight who does what. 

So instead of this:

"advocacy on renewables" 

try this:

"NGOs conduct advocacy campaign on renewables".  

In particular, avoid using passive formulations like "Advocacy is carried out" or "Awareness is raised".
