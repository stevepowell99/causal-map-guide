# ðŸ“š Factor labels: actor-focused{#xfactor-labels-actors}



Often you will find that it is easier and clearer if you formulate your labels to highlight who does what. 

So instead of this:

<u>advocacy on renewables</u>

try this:

<u>NGOs conduct advocacy campaign on renewables</u>.  

In particular, avoid using passive formulations like "Advocacy is carried out" or "Awareness is raised".
