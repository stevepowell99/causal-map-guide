# The Links Table{#xthe-links-table}

This table counts factors differently to [the mentions table](#xthe-mentions-table) as it counts links rather than individual factor mentions. Each row represents one link and has columns for that linkâ€™s influence factor and consequence factor, as well as many other columns. This table is also linked to the [statements](#xthe-statements-table) and [sources](#xthe-sources-table) tables. Use this table to show the links between factor labels. Information like the related quote is also available in this table. 

This table has three available presets:

- `Links (basic)` as shown below, which gives you information about each individual link

- `Frequent bundles` which shows the source_frequency for each link bundle
- `Hashtags` which shows the hashtags used and their source_frequency

### Fields

There are many fields you can use as columns or rows, such as:

- `simple_bundle`. Shows the whole link, both the influence and consequence factor.
- `from`. Contains numbers which match the factor_ids of the factors.
- `to`. Contains numbers which match the factor_ids of the factors.
- `statement_id`. Contains numbers which match the statement_ids of the statements.
- `link_memo`. For making notes about a link as you code.
- `hashtags`. [Re-usable tags](#xhashtags) which are usually common across several links, for example #hypothetical or #certain or #check.
