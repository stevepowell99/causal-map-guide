## What do you want to do?

///View a specific filtered map which someone sent you a link to
If you have been [sent a link](#xinvite) to a specific map by someone you will be automatically taken to view this map (or table) once you click on the link, providing they have given you the correct permissions.

///View a specific project (aka 'mapfile')
If you have been asked to log in to view a whole project, click on the dropdown list on the left-hand side and click on the relevant file to load it. This will then load that project, providing you have been given the correct permissions.

///Just explore the app
If you have just loaded the app without clicking on a link, you will be taken to an example file called `example-file`. You can also create your own file by [copying the example file](#xown-copy) or [uploading your own](#ximport), this file will then be added to the dropdown list in the top left-hand side.

## Exploring a file
Once you load a file you can see how data has been [coded](#xcoding-panel), look at transcripts using the ['book' buttons](#xstatement-nav), or create your own maps using the [filters](xintro-filters).

You won't be able to change anything if you have View Only access to a file, but you can still [take a look around](#quick-tour) and have a play with the [filters](#xintro-filters) and [tables](x#all-tables).

And if you want to try coding give it a go with the help of the [coding section](#xcoding-panel)!
