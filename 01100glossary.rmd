## Generic terminology for qualitative causal mapping

We collect qualitative data in the form of **text**. 

**Coding** that textual data means **highlighting** pieces of text which express **causal links** (or **causal claims**) between two (or more) **causal factors**. To code a causal link we specify a causal factor at the beginning of the link (“**influence factor**”) and a causal factor at the end of the link (“**consequence factor**”). You create labels for the causal factors, e.g. Increased crop yields. Usually you will start to reuse these same factors to create new causal links as you continue coding.

Some causal claims can be coded as just a single link between two factors like this.

In the most basic case, a link means simply that C has some kind of causal influence over D; we could say it makes a **causal contribution** to D, or it **causally influences** D. 

Often we will code a causal claim as a chain like this. These chains are particularly important in QuIP, where we try to trace outcomes back to their drivers:

Sometimes claims are more complex; in general we can call each claim a **causal map** (or a “**sub-map**” to make clear that it is only part of a larger story).

In order to ease interpretation, with a few exceptions, factors should be labelled and understood in such a way that it makes sense to say “more of this” or “less of this” or “this happened” or “this didn’t happen”: we call these semi-quantitative factors. 

These factor names can optionally also include flags: fragments of text, for example, *(Farming).* These should be chosen so they are easy to search for and wouldn’t come up in another factor label to mean something different. General terms, such as *(Farming),* can be used to organise the factors into **themes**. Analysts can also use flags to mark factors associated with specific interventions or project inputs, for example the word “*Intervention*”, as well as to mark factors which are regarded (usually in conversation with the evaluation commissioner) as desirable outcomes, e.g. by using the word “*Outcome*”.  

 

**Causal factors** can also optionally be **nested** within one another. This means for example that it is possible to view **zoom out** to see just the higher-level factors, with their subsidiary factors ‘rolled up’ into them. 

Additional coding possibilities for advanced users (more about these later in the guide):

●    **Hashtag****:** you can use these to make any notes about the *links*, e.g. to note that a link mentions a particular topic or type of statement (e.g. #future) or is a link that you want to review later. Hashtags can use an actual hashtag, e.g. *#hashtag*, but don’t have to, e.g. *hashtag*.

●    **Memo****:** as is standard in qualitative social research, as an analyst you can make short memos of any type on each statement, as well as about each causal link, each factor and the project globally.

●    **Strength** and **actualisation** of the causal link.

 

A useful concept is that of a **bundle** of links, i.e. sets of links which are coterminal, i.e. between the same influence and consequence factors, usually mentioned in different statements by different sources. These can be shown separately or, with certain caveats, together, with a thicker line and/or marked with a label to show the number of links in the bundle. 

Each individual piece of text is called a **statement**, usually this is a sentence, a paragraph or a few paragraphs. Each statement has an ID; a number like 1, 2, 3 etc.

Each statement usually has **additional data** associated with it, e.g. respondent ID number, respondent age, question number. An additional data **field** like “age” usually has various **values**, e.g. 0-20, 21-30. 

We call the set of statements (and possibly the set of respondents etc.) which correspond to a particular value of a particular field a group, e.g. the group of women. 

Usually, statements come from a set of **sources**; in QuIP and in most other kinds of study these are usually *respondents* – individual people or individual focus groups – but in other contexts the statements come from a set of *documents*. Each source is usually associated with several documents. In the app, you can, for example, search for all the statements made by a particular respondent (in the app, the term “source” is used rather than the term “respondent”). 

 

## Formatting in this guide…

We display statements and quotes from them, respondents’ actual words, in quote marks:

“Thanks to the financial support, I can now go to school”

We display factor labels with underlines, like this:

<u>Able to go to school</u>

When we display whole coded causal claims which include an arrow, we don’t use the underlines:

Financial support ➜ Able to go to school 


This first part of the Guide covers all the basic ideas of causal mapping. The second part covers some additional ideas, which correspond to the features enabled for those with "Extra" subscriptions to the Causal Map app.

Bundle:

Any links between any pair of factors can be called the original links; these links can be bundled so they visually look like one. The "simple bundle" is just all of the links bundled into one bundle, but you can also create more than one bundle if you e.g. bundle by source_id. Once you bundle the links, you can point to the bundle and say, look, a bundle. But if someone calls it a link that is ok too, providing we are clear that this link aka bundle may contain several original links.

File: "File" specifically for what we used to call "projects" within the app.
