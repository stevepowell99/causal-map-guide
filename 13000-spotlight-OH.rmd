# Spotlight: Causal Mapping and Outcome Harvesting

Causal mapping and Outcome Harvesting can complement each other in a number of ways, combining the particular strengths of OH, such as a clearly documented way to identify and validate specific claims of important changes, with the particular strengths of causal mapping, such as understanding how simple contribution/outcome stories can chain together into a bigger picture.

One way is to use causal mapping after an OH process, perhaps focusing on a subset of the data. [presentation in preparation]

Another way is to use causal mapping when OH has already been used for monitoring, to assemble provisional material and help identify possible outcome statements for further validation.
