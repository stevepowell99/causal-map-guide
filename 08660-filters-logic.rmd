# What is the logic behind the Causal Map filters?

## Keeping it simple



It's easy to end up with complicated filters. It can get hard to explain to someone else (or even understand yourself) what is going on. Ideally you should have a clear model of what you are doing and be fairly consistent about it, and be able to explain and defend it. There is no difference on this point between qualitative and quantitative analyses.



## Autocorrect{#xautocorrect}

The app does quite a bit of autocorrect for you. It enforces the filter logic. You will sometimes see lines in the Advanced Editor moving around, deleting themselves etc. 

An example: 

You can't have more than one `set print` filter, but you can have more than one `find factors` filter.

Another example: 

ðŸ§ª The app needs to delete preceding `label links` filters in some cases, but not if preceded by another `label links` filter if `clear_previous=TRUE`. 

The point is to let you chain labels together if you want say source count and also gender, but to delete extraneous label links filters if you are *not* chaining the labels.

## Where do these islands come from?

**It's a really frequent problem that you do either a path tracing or a "find factors containing blah and two steps down etc" and then "select ..." to reduce number of factors or links, and then you get islands of stuff which don't seem to be related.**

If you ensure that your select filters come earlier, you never get these islands and the resulting map makes sense as a product of the find or trace filter which you did. 

This might seem a bit back to front, because in your working steps you usually apply a Find and then try to simplify it. It is also a bit strange in the sense that the numbers on the Select filter aren't as easy to guess. But it works. 

In the same vein, it often makes sense to put any "find links" or "find statements" filters, e.g. looking for a particular village, right at the start. 

Causal Map in any case enforces an ordering of the filters:

1) Analysis filters (each of these can appear more than once)

2) Conditional formatting filters (each of these can only appear once)

3) Simple filters (each of these can only appear once)
