<p>The Causal Map App contributed to the evaluation of the World Food Programme (WFP) market development activities and related food systems support activities in Southern Africa from 2018 to 2021. Data from key informant interviews and focus group discussions with retailers in four countries (Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe) were coded and mapped out using Causal Map to illustrate trends, anomalies, and possible entry points. The WFP used maps and table from the app to clearly visualise the research findings in their report.</p>

<p>Oct-Dec 2018. Impact of academic support, Anamaria Golemac Powell &amp; Steve Powell.</p>

<p><a href="https://globalyoungacademy.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/GYA-Impact-Analyisis-2018-Technical-Appendix.pdf">Full report</a></p>
<p>This report used a very early version of Causal Map.</p>
<p>The Global Young Academy supports young scientists around the world to connect with
other young scientists, develop their careers and work towards solving global problems
with science. We asked over 100 people, who had been supported by GYA or were
otherwise involved in the programme, to tell us stories about positive changes which had
happened because of GYA activities. We used an online survey.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="_assets/a5fe43e040d834d29f87af7e2dc8daa9.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">GYA study</p>
</div>
<p>We analysed the stories looking for examples of where people had said that ùêµ leads to ùê∂ -
for example, where someone said ‚ÄúI loved the regional meetings because they helped me
widen my professional network‚Äù. Then all the ùêµ s (like, Global and regional interaction) and
all the ùê∂ s (like networks, friendships, support) were grouped into themes, which are the
boxes in the diagram below: a Theory of Change for GYA. All the individual stories linking ùêµ s and ùê∂ s are synthesised into one story using a pre-defined set of analysis steps.</p>
<p>The factors which people mentioned sort themselves into three layers, reading from left-to-
right: GYA inputs, individual impacts and broader impacts. So taken together, people told
us about a range of GYA inputs which led mainly to a range of impacts on individuals. These
impacts on individuals also led to some broader impacts like ‚Äúimproved learning &amp;
teaching‚Äù on the right-hand-side. People also quite frequently mentioned direct links from
GYA inputs to these broader impacts. The diagram reveals a lot of insights, like these:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>People, especially women, reported that GYA activities, especially global and regional
interaction like attending conferences, had many positive personal influences like
establishing support networks with other young scientists.</p></li>
<li><p>At the heart of the theory of change is that young scientists themselves adopt GYA‚Äôs
values and vision, which enables them to go on to have broader impacts like improving
teaching.</p></li>
<li><p>Women, especially younger women, most often mentioned ‚Äúsolving world problems‚Äù
as a broader impact, while men often mentioned interdisciplinary interaction leading
to international projects and publications.</p></li>
<li><p>Older people mentioned GYA membership and office-holding as important inputs, and
most frequently mentioned how they had learned soft skills and in particular
management skills through GYA participation, whereas younger people, especially
women, mentioned training inputs and how they led to career opportunities.</p></li>

<p>This report, written by Steve Powell, used an early version of Causal Map.</p>
<div id="background" class="section level4" number="80.1.5.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">80.1.5.1</span> Background</h4>
<p>After the powerful earthquake which struck Nepal in April 2015, the International Red Cross Red and Crescent Movement (‚Äúthe Movement‚Äù), among others, mobilized the full range of their resources to support the relief and recovery efforts, in line with Nepal government‚Äôs overall strategy, to support the Nepal Red Cross Society (NRCS) in leading the response. NRCS, IFRC and in-country Participating National Societies (PNSs) came to an agreement that individual partners will conduct their own final evaluations of individual projects, rather than a combined final evaluation. So it was proposed to also conduct a meta-evaluation of the individual final evaluations together with all other reviews and thematic studies conducted 2015 ‚Äì 2019.<br />
This report presents the results of that meta-evaluation.</p>
<p><img src="_assets/f184ac06895268db126fca2e3d51ed31.png" alt="f184ac06895268db126fca2e3d51ed31.png" />Overall top-level theory of change emerging from the documents</p>
</div>
<div id="method" class="section level4" number="80.1.5.2">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">80.1.5.2</span> Method</h4>
<p>A central part of the report was a qualitative synthesis of the summaries of over 30 evaluative reports. The methodology is described in the section beginning on p.¬†22. The design was partially deductive because some main high-level causal factors like Actions and Outcomes were pre-determined, and partly inductive because many lower-level factors were identified within these high-level groups.</p>
<p>The procedure was to read and analyse or ‚Äúcode‚Äù each of the main documents in turn.
The focus was on the executive summary and conclusions sections of the primary
documents, as these already represent an effort by the respective authors to summarise
their own documents. The full text of the documents was considered mainly in order
deepen understanding of the summaries.</p>
<p>This qualitative procedure, known as ‚Äúcoding‚Äù, made use of qualitative text analysis
software, Causal Map, software developed by Bath SDR and the evaluator, which is
specialised for evaluations because it makes it possible to capture reports of causal
connections.</p>
<p>This coding approach was used in order to ensure that the reports were
synthesised in a systematic and transparent way.</p>
<p>The coding process: Important claims of causal contribution (e.g.¬†‚ÄúThis WASH training
element succeeded in raising hygiene awareness, but only amongst women‚Äù) in the main
documents were highlighted and used to construct a theory of change or ‚Äúcausal map‚Äù.
Each such piece of evidence was coded as a link showing how one factor (in the example,
‚Äúthe WASH training element‚Äù) influenced another (in the example, ‚Äúraised hygiene
awareness, but only amongst women‚Äù). Each link is associated with a specific verbatim
quote from the evaluative reports along with the metadata e.g.¬†report title, date, page
number, etc. This metadata captures information on the context in which the quote is
relevant.</p>
<p>The final theory of change consists of a large number of arrows or links.<br />
Capturing information about causal contribution in this way makes it possible to ask
questions about the influences on a particular factor, and in turn what it influenced,
combining information from different reports.</p>
<p><img src="_assets/ff6196596cc415b9eec16a64ed3d02bb.png" alt="ff6196596cc415b9eec16a64ed3d02bb.png" />
Generic theory of change</p>
<p>An initial, generic theory of change used as a starting point for the qualitative analysis.<br />
The coding process started out assuming a generic theory of change with the above,
generic, form. It gained more specific detail as the analysis proceeded and more specific
details emerged: the individual causal factors were organised hierarchically under the
headings in the diagram as follows.</p>
</div>
<div id="hierarchy" class="section level4" number="80.1.5.3">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">80.1.5.3</span> Hierarchy</h4>
<p>Coding the reports as outlined above identified 470 causal factors mentioned in the
reports, which is quite a large number. So a hierarchy of causal factors was created by
breaking up these 470 into a smaller number of common, reusable components
(‚ÄúWASH‚Äù, ‚ÄúDesign‚Äù etc).</p>
<p><img src="_assets/4a5c0401a54c9651c46474a1f85f8d9e.png" alt="4a5c0401a54c9651c46474a1f85f8d9e.png" />Coding a quote from one of the main documents as a link between two causal factors.</p>
<p>Rather than coding this statement: ‚ÄúIncluding CEA in the design for WASH activities
improved all the WASH outcomes‚Äù as a link between two monolithic causal factors, it was
coded as a link between two factors which are themselves made up of a number of more
generic elements.</p>
<p><img src="_assets/b08c8cb0fc79b3ef6dfe65d3e9a2493a.png" alt="b08c8cb0fc79b3ef6dfe65d3e9a2493a.png" />
A more efficient way to code a quote from one of the main documents as a link between
two causal factors, each of which is hierarchically organised.</p>
<p>For example, the first part of ‚ÄúIncluding CEA in the design for WASH activities improved all the WASH
outcomes‚Äù is encoded as ‚ÄúDesign&gt;WASH&gt;CEA‚Äù which is also part of a broader factor ‚ÄúDesign&gt;WASH‚Äù
which is in turn part of the top-level factor ‚ÄúDesign‚Äù. ‚ÄúDesign&gt;WASH&gt;CEA‚Äù can be read ‚Äúthe CEA part of
the WASH part of the Design process‚Äù.</p>
<p>This hierarchy of factors was developed iteratively during the coding process, beginning
with an initial hierarchy (just ‚ÄúInput‚Äù ‚ÄúAction‚Äù and ‚ÄúOutcome‚Äù), which was then modified
to best fit the actual contents of the documents following the usual iterative approach
applied in qualitative text analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="positive-links-and-other-links" class="section level4" number="80.1.5.4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">80.1.5.4</span> ‚ÄúPositive‚Äù links and ‚ÄúOther‚Äù links</h4>
<p>Sometimes the documents contained information about the strength and direction of the
influence of one factor on another, e.g.¬†a strong and negative change to factor C causes a
small and positive change to factor E. More details of how this was captured are given in
an Appendix on p.¬†76. For the purposes of reporting,, links are organised in just two
groups: ‚Äúpositive‚Äù links and ‚Äúother‚Äù links. ‚ÄúPositive‚Äù links are all those in which a normal,
expected amount of one factor brings about a normal, positive change in another. All the
other links are ones which are in some way different, less than optimal, or hypothetical.</p>

<p>Causal maps were displayed as Sankey Diagrams, which are not used in newer versions of Causal Map.</p>
<p>All the relevant causal claims were also provided as a long annex to the main report, grouped according to theme.</p>
