# Just received an invite to view something in Causal Map?{#xinvite}

Someone sent you a link like https://causalmap.shinyapps.io/CausalMap2/?s=99 so you can view and explore their file?

Assuming they also remembered to give you permissions to view the file :smile: once you are logged in, the link will take you straight to a specific view of a specific file (a specific map or table) with a specific set of filters applied. You can then add or take away your own filters if you would like to explore further.
