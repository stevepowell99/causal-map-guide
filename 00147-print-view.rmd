#  Print view{#print-view}

A print-quality version of the map with advanced layout. For a brief summary of the tab please see the [previous section](#xinteractive-view).

When you are viewing a single statement, the colour of the links corresponds to the colour of the highlighted sections of text.

- If you have edit permissions, you can edit a link by clicking on its label -- if there is no label, click the small dot where the label would be.

- If you have edit permissions, you can edit a factor by clicking on its label.

- If you hover over the link itself (which can be a bit tricky if the link is thin), you will see a tooltip displaying the names of the influence and consequence factors.

- If you hover over the link label you will see a tooltip displaying the link_ids of the influence and consequence factors.-->
