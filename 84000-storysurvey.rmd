# Using StorySurvey

This documentation is work in progress.



## Frequent questions

**How to use StorySurvey in a different language?**

Just add the [two-letter code for a specific language](https://causalmap.shinyapps.io/StorySurvey3/?survey=local-problems) to the end of the URL like this:

https://causalmap.shinyapps.io/StorySurvey3/?survey=local-problems&lang=fr



**Is StorySurvey publicly released?**

Yes! At the moment we are using it with a small number of partners, but you are welcome to create your own interviews.



**How are respondents invited?**

At the moment, you as survey editor invite respondents to participate simply via a web link. You can send that link to anyone you like.



**Are surveys private?**

A survey can be made private so that no-one else can find the survey except if they know the link. 



**Can someone fill in a survey twice?**

Normally, respondents are prevented from filling in a survey twice via a cookie, but if they were clever enough they could get round that and fill in a survey more than once. 

However, we can also enable "token mode" so that you can send an individualised (anonymous or not) link to each respondent, so that only they can respond and so that each respondent can only finish the survey once.

 

**What if a respondent loses the internet connection?**

StorySurvey remembers respondents' sessions, so that if they don't get round to completing the survey or if a connection breaks, they can resume later as long as they use the same device.

 

**How to log in to edit the survey?**

StorySurvey does not require respondents to log in in any way. 

If we at Causal Map are deploying the StorySurvey for you, that is all you need to worry about. However if you want, you can log in with a Google account or email to view and edit the surveys to which you have access.



**Where is the data stored?**

StorySurvey (questions and answers and other settings) are securely stored in a private MySQL database at Amazon EC2. Like most web apps, StorySurvey uses SSL to encrypt data in transit.
