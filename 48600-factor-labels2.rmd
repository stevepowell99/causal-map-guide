### QuIP specific: back-chaining

In QuIP projects, most of the interview material comes in response to questions about changes in the reference period, usually the last three years. QuIP questioning continues back up the causal chain, asking what was the reason for that? ‚Ä¶ and the reason for that? That means that most influence factors will also be expressed as changes or differences (a change in F is explained by a change in E which is explained by a change in D‚Ä¶.), whereas some are not (e.g. ‚Äúunemployment‚Äù). Some analysts will try to avoid coding this kind of claim (can something which has been around a long time explain a change in the last three years?) but you may decide that this distinction does not matter too much. If something really does describe a *change* (e.g. ‚Äúbecame unemployed‚Äù) then it should be coded.

Most QuIP testimony begins with questions about whether things have got better or worse, so most causal factors, going back up the causal chain, are likely to be semi-quantitative too.



## Opposed pairs of causal factors

What to do when some explanations use a causal factor phrased in a positive way and others use a similar causal factor but phrased the other way around?

‚ÄúI feel good because my health is good.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy sister lost her job because her health is bad.‚Äù

We could code these:

Health improved ‚ûú Feel good

Health got worse ‚ûú Lost job

But we might feel we are missing the fact that the first factor in each case is arguably the same thing, just the other way around.

Solution 1: do nothing

This may mean you find yourself using pairs of opposing factors such as Better health and Worse health to capture the causal claims ‚Äì things which are in a sense the opposite of one another. You might decide that is fine anyway, because you are happy to have pairs of factors like this, or because you decide that the pair of factors are not really polar opposites at all and therefore you don‚Äôt want to combine them. For example, illness is arguably not really simply the opposite of health but a quite different state with its own causal rules.

Solution 2: merge them

If you use more advanced coding styles involving ‚Äústrength,‚Äù detailed in the ‚ÄúExtra‚Äù section of this Guide, you can avoid this by just using one factor like Better health.

Alternatively, ‚ÄòHealth Improved‚Äô and ‚ÄòHealth got Worse‚Äô could be coded as ‚ÄòHealth Improved‚Äô and ‚Äò~Health Improved‚Äô respectively, with ‚Äò~‚Äô indicating the ‚Äòopposite‚Äô of an improvement in health. The app will then treat links to Health Improved and ~Health Improved separately. [More information on this can be found here.](https://guide.causalmap.app/coding-opposites.html#combining-opposites)

## Formulating factors as desirable

If possible, especially when conducting evaluations or research for policy purposes, try to formulate these semi-quantitative factors so that for each one, *more* of it can be broadly thought of as *more desirable*, e.g. Health, Wellbeing; and failing that, as something *undesirable*, e.g. Psychosocial Stress, Mortality. Including factors which primarily code something undesirable as well as factors which primarily code something desirable, is often very natural, but you might sometimes have to think more carefully when making reports and summaries.

Again, it is least useful, but also perfectly acceptable and sometimes necessary, to fall back to using factor labels which are ambiguous as to their desirability, e.g. Moved house*,* if there is a lack of information or in the case of factors which simply are neutral.

## Examples of non-quantitative factors

These are examples of factors where it is very hard to quantify the occurrence in any way:

- Teaching style
- Coping strategy
- The content of the report

We call these non-quantitative factors. We might try to reword them as semi-quantitative factors like this:

- Helpfulness of teaching style
- Positiveness of report

The diagram below is an acceptable causal map, even though the intervening two variables are an example of more qualitative rather than (semi-)quantitative labels. It tells us that the training did something to the teaching style, which did something relevant to the learning style, which improved student outcomes. We don‚Äôt have a theory about the ‚Äúhow‚Äù of any of the arrows, and we don‚Äôt (necessarily) suggest that teaching style or learning style are things which can be measured on a single scale from e.g. ‚Äúless‚Äù to ‚Äúmore.‚Äù



### Hanging flags{#xhanging-flags}

A subtle trick is to use hanging flags which are additional hierarchical components. So rather than writing, say,

>More food #nutrition --> Improved wellbeing

you write

>More food; #nutrition --> Improved wellbeing

(note the `;` ), then  if you "zoom out" to the top level of the hierarchy, the flag will be neatly hidden:

>More food --> Improved wellbeing

### Flags for bundling factors

It is very convenient to use flags when you want to [bundle factors](#bundlefactors). This means you can easily collapse together one or more sets of factors sharing a common theme, regardless and independently of any hierarchical structure you are using.




### Intervention Flags

The commissioner of an evaluation will nearly always want to be able to focus on their own interventions, so it is advisable to use a consistent label or category across all factors which are noted as project inputs in order to be easily searchable. These will usually be influence factors with no parents, i.e. factors which have no incoming influence factors.

In the example below, both are similar interventions, but one is clearly attributable to an NGO.

‚ÄúMSF gave us medicines which healed the children‚Äù

MSF gave medicines ‚Äì> children healed

‚ÄúSomeone gave us medicines which healed the children‚Äù

Unknown actor gave medicines ‚Äì> children healed

You have a range of options to flag this difference in the label and enable you to filter for all project-related interventions once the data is coded.

¬∑ All such interventions can be labelled with the NGO‚Äôs name

¬∑ If you are doing nested coding, you can nest such factors within a higher-level factor like ‚ÄòInterventions;‚Äô

¬∑ And/or you can use a specific intervention flag, e.g. #Intervention. (QuIP has its own flags, [I] for Implicit and [E] for Explicit).

You can use any label you want as long as you are sure it is unique, it doesn‚Äôt appear accidentally in other factor names, and you use it consistently.

### Outcome Flags

Similarly, if you wish to flag up outcomes /consequences as either desired/desirable/valued, or the inverse, you can mark these in a way which makes them easy to identify. You could use symbols like ‚ô• etc. in the labels to designate this, or use use QuIP-style labels [P] for positive and [N] for negative. This can be helpful when undertaking analysis; for example, displaying direct and indirect links from some or all of the intervention factors to some or all of the positive outcome factors or highlighting or counting paths leading to all negative outcome factors, etc.

Again, you can use any label you want as long as you are sure it is unique, it doesn‚Äôt appear accidentally in other factor names, and you use it consistently.



## Consolidating and editing factor labels

After you have created more than about 50 factors you will probably feel the need to start consolidating and renaming them and perhaps merging some.

If you look at the Mentions table in the app, you will probably find a lot of *pairs* of factors each of which is used only once, as half of this particular pair, and don‚Äôt appear linked into longer stories. We almost certainly will want to consolidate some of these factors by in some way merging them with others which have similar meaning.

Suppose you have 100 factors which are just mentioned once or twice. It‚Äôs a lot of work to do all that coding, a lot of work for almost nothing, because those very infrequent factors (we call them ‚Äútiddlers‚Äù) are unlikely to appear much in any reporting you do. With hierarchical coding, even infrequent factors can contribute to the bigger picture.

Before we even think about consolidating factors, do remember the golden rule that, **when coding a new link, always look at your existing factors and try selecting one of those before creating a new one.** Even if you think an existing factor isn‚Äôt quite a perfect fit, you can use it and adjust the factor name later. Ideally you will always be able to think of labels for your factors which are at least general enough to cover a few different cases.

It can be helpful to reformulate factor labels so that some common themes come *first*:

- ‚Äúcommunication difficulties - intercultural‚Äù
- ‚Äúcommunication difficulties - lack of internet‚Äù

This is useful when the factors are listed alphabetically and can be a stepping-stone to formulating factors hierarchically.

Even when doing inductive coding, some people formulate factors with a theory in mind, with some higher-level factors like ‚Äúcommunication difficulties‚Äù or ‚Äúresilient outcomes.‚Äù However we have found that it is often most interesting when you let the theory emerge rather than by starting with a preconceived template in this way. Look at your factors periodically as you code and see if there are any obvious groups.

Also, our recommended way of having your cake and eating it - keeping the detail but seeing the general trends too ‚Äì is ‚Äúhierarchical coding.‚Äù [See below](https://guide.causalmap.app/creating.html#simplifying-causal-maps-with-hierarchical-coding).

### Merging multiple factors into one

In some cases you will simply decide, in the face of too many factors, to merge `Engagement with communities` and `NGO engagement`into one, e.g. `Engagement`.

If you have two factors like this which are very similar but not quite the same, you can sometimes keep some detail by using a composite label which explicitly mentions both i.e.`Engagement with communities/NGOs`.
