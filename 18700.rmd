## Frequently asked questions


### When I highlight a single word or very short phrase, why is the same word highlighted but in a different part of the statement?

If you highlight a very short piece of text which happens to appear (exactly the same) more than once in the statement, it is always the **first** occurrence of this piece of text which is actually highlighted. 


### Help, I've forgotten one statement and need to add it!

It's easy enough to press the `+` button you can see when you are looking at your statements in `Code & View`, to add a new statement, then press the edit button to actually edit it and paste in the text. 

The new statement will be added at the end, as the last statement in your data.

However, you'll have to manually update the additional data for this table. So as a second step, go to the `Update & Fix` tab, scroll down to the new statement at the bottom of the table on the right hand side, and you'll see that your additional data fields are missing for this row - so you'll have to copy and paste these details as appropriate, for example by copying an appropriate row from elsewhere in the table.

## QuIP questions

### How do I prepare my data from a QuIP project for import into Causal Map?

There isn't an official QUIP way but uploading/importing data into Causal Map should be pretty simple. 

It does depend on how you actually collect your data, for example from word files or ODK or similar. 

There are basically two approaches but other variants are possible too.

#### Separate tables

The first table is uploaded/imported to the app as the main statements table and the other two tables can easily be added after that. 

##### Table 1: statements

In the first approach you simply enter the text of each statement in a single column of a spreadsheet file with the heading "text". One row per statement. statement is usually round about a paragraph but it could be as short as a sentence or several paragraphs if that's convenient. then you'd usually have two more columns one for respondent ID and one for question ID. That means for each statement you know the respondent and the question.  


##### Table 2: respondents

Then you usually have a second table giving more details of each respondent, for example gender.


##### Table 3: questions

This third table give you more details about each question, for example question text. 


#### One big table

The second approach is to combine all of this information into a single table, which you just upload as the main statements table and that's it. In this approach any additional columns like gender or question text have to be added to the main table so they are quite repetitive. So if respondents 1 2 and 3 are all female and they have 20 statements each then you will see the word female 60 times in a column called "gender".

## Known bugs

### When I want to visit the app again after a while, I go to the tab with go.causalmap.app and refresh it, but I just get a box which tells me to refresh again

Yes, we know, it is really annoying. Our authentication provider is somehow being too picky. You can usually fix this by hitting Refresh a few times, if not please just close the tab and open a new one, and visit go.causalmap.app from there.

### When I switch between files, I can't highlight text inside statements in order to code them

Sorry, yes we're working on it. For now, you'll have to refresh your browser and load up the project again. 

### I canâ€™t make the quotes panel appear when I hover over a link

The quotes panel only opens up again, after it has closed, if you hover over a *new* link. So, if you hover over a particular arrow to make the panel appear, and wait for it to disappear, and then move back over the same arrow, the panel won't appear again. This is annoying but much harder to fix.

### I click on a link to edit it, but the edit panel does not open

The edit panel only opens up again, after it has closed, if you click on a *new* link. So, if the panel won't open, try clicking on the map background or on a *different* link and then return to click on the one you wanted.



## How do I ...?

### Can I create more than one link at a time?

Yes. You can create multiple links at a time just by putting more than one factor in either or both boxes.


### Can I edit more than one link at a time?

No. You can only edit one link at a time. We may add this capability in future.

### How do I link two existing chains?

To link a chain a --> b --> c to a chain d --> e, highlight the part of the statement which provides the evidence and then code a link from c to d using the dropdowns as usual.
