# Analysing causal maps{#xanalysis}

Various kinds of software are available to simplify the task of viewing and filtering a causal map, especially for larger maps. For example, [gephi.org](http://gephi.org) is a good choice for very rapidly manipulating even very large maps - much larger than Causal Map can handle.

A causal map can be filtered to show only some parts of it. Some submaps are well-known from network analysis, for example the “ego network” for a particular factor is the part of the map which includes only those factors directly connected to it. This is something like searching for that particular factor.

A related approach is to specify one set of Source factors and another set of Target factors and to display only the links along paths which lead from a Source factor to a Target factor. This is called an “etiograph” in a seminal organisational analysis of Utrecht Jazz Orchestra (Bougon, Weick, & Binkhorst, 1977).
