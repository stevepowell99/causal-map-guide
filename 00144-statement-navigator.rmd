By clicking on the green book icon you can see all the statements from all sources or the black book icon will show the transcript from the respondent whose statement you are currently viewing.

You can use the arrow and numbered button to skip through statements. If you want to skip to a particular statement the easiest way is to use the [find statements](xfind-statements-links) filter. This will automatically be applied if you are viewing statements one at a time, so simply click on the filter and edit the number it is searching for.
