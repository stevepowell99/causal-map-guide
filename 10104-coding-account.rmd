**Free accounts**

You create an account just by logging in. You can create a new file and do some coding and analysis. 

**Paid subscriptions**

You log in as usual, but to code more than 50 links you need to have a [subscription](https://causalmap.app/subscriptions/).

To cancel, renew or manage your subscription see this [section](#xmanage_your_subscription).

If you have a paid subscription, make sure you used the email you use to login is the same as the one for which you have a subscription.
