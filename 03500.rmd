# üíª Viewing the Causal Map app{.hi #viewing}

::: {.focus}
This section is just about how to view a file on Causal Map with a view-only account. 
:::

You will be able to:

* See the overall map
* Filter the global map by: Current statement; Factor label; [Link (quote, hashtag, memo etc)](#filtering-the-map-by-link-hashtag-memo); [Statement](#filtering-the-map-by-statement-source-question) (text, additional data e.g.¬†respondent characteristics)
* See a summary of all statements from a specific source
* See additional information about each statement (e.g.¬†question and respondent characteristics)
* Simplify the map by¬†‚Äúzooming out‚Äù or showing only most frequent factors or links
* Trace paths from one set of factors to another
* Show maps which are distinctive for a specific group e.g.¬†women
* Create detailed tables: Factors; Sample; Questions; Differences; Closed questions
* Calculate **Quantity of Evidence** for causal paths between sets of factors



## Logging in

Start your journey at go.causalmap.app. You will see a screen like this:

(Note: the email field is **not** case sensitive)



  


## Choosing files


You will then see a screen like this:

![image-20210224131612576](_assets/image-20210224131612576.png)

The files you are able to view, are listed in the first box in the file chooser (above), with the ones you viewed most recently listed first. You can just use your mouse to select a file, or, as with all menus like this in Causal Map, you can press your delete key and type to search for files.

You should then wait for the file to fully load (if it takes longer than a minute, try pressing ‚ÄúDismiss‚Äù). 

## üíª Overview of the app: The Code & View tab

You will spend nearly all of your time in the Code & View tab, which is described further down in this section. 


### üíª The left-hand panels

You can resize the left-hand panels in relation to the right-hand panels by dragging the right-hand edge of the left panel to the left or right.

#### Filters

There are various [filters](#analysis) which can be applied to the maps, quotes, and tables to analyse the data. 

More information on the individual filters can be found [later on in this Guide](#analysis).

Firstly, if you want to view the dataset as a whole, make sure View statements one by one filter is off by clicking on the toggle (it should turn from green to grey). 

![image-20210108212920731](_assets/image-20210108212920731.png)

 The Show filters panel should then automatically open. If it doesn‚Äôt, click on the toggle (it should turn from grey to green).

 ![image-20210108212929350](_assets/image-20210108212929350.png)

- You can open and close each filter shown in the filter panel by using the toggles. 

- When you select and apply a filter, the visualisations, quotes, and tables on the right will update. 

- You can apply multiple filters at once. 

- The filter bar will be highlighted in pink if you have applied any filters ‚Äì always be aware of which filters you have applied and remember to be transparent about these in your reporting. 

```{r,echo=F,class="show_mark"}
show_mark("Interface/show-filters.md" )

```

#### Viewing your statements

```{r,echo=F}
show_mark("Interface/show-statement-pager-combo.md")
```

### üíª The right-hand panels

There are four main panels which present and visualise the data. More information on each can be found later on in this Guide.

#### Interactive

This interactive causal map displays all the causal links between factors which correspond with your search/filter criteria. You can drag factors around using your mouse to rearrange the map. You can also view the quotes associated any of the causal links by hovering over the arrow that connects the two factors.

#### Print

Here you‚Äôll find a [high-quality static map](#viewing-the-print-map) which is particularly useful for including in reports as it presents the causal stories clearly. 

#### Quotes

Here you will see a list of all the quotes which correspond to the filters you have applied. This is useful for selecting and copying quotes related to particular stories of change, to include in the report. 

#### Quantity of Evidence (QE)

If you have selected factors in both the ‚ÄúSource Factor‚Äù and ‚ÄúTarget Factor‚Äù filters, the app traces all the paths from the Source factor(s) to the Target factor(s). This panel then calculates for you the *robustness of the argument* that the source factor(s) influence the target factor(s). 

#### Tables

Here you will find a selection of tables giving information about the factors and links in the current view, and other data associated with them, such as characteristics of the corresponding sample of respondents.
