## Formatting in this guide…

We display statements and quotes from them, respondents’ actual words, in quote marks:

“Thanks to the financial support, I can now go to school”

We display factor labels with underlines, like this:

<u>Able to go to school</u>

When we display whole coded causal claims which include an arrow, we don’t use the underlines:

Financial support ➜ Able to go to school
