# Importing your data: special cases{#ximport-other}



## ðŸ§ªImporting existing causal coding ("links only"){#xlinks-only}

What to do if you have causal information, for example in the form of **edge lists**, from some other source (e.g. AI coding of a larger text) which you want to import? 

You can import this kind of file too, using the Standard Format Excel upload button. 

Your Excel xlsx file should NOT have a tab for factors. Instead it should have a single tab called `links`, containing two columns called `from_label` and `to_label` which contain the names of your factors.

That's the basic setup. But maybe you also want to provide information about what statement, question or source the link is associated with. In which case, these are your options:

- Optionally, your links tab can also contain other columns as usual, in particular it can contain the column `question_id`. 
- If you include a `question_id` column, you should include an additional tab called `questions` containing at least the column `question_id`  and other columns providing information about the questions, e.g. full question text, questionnaire section etc, where relevant.   
- Optionally, your links tab can also contain a column `statement_id`.
- If you include a `statement_id` column, you can optionally include, as usual, an additional tab called `statements` containing at least the column `statement_id`  and a column `text` containing the text of your statements.
  - If you optionally include a `statements` tab, you can optionally also include a `source_id` column and a corresponding tab called `sources` with a corresponding `source_id` column and more columns to provide information like gender, location, or any other information about the source of each statement.

- Optionally, your links tab can also contain a column labelled  `quote`, containing the actual quote which underpins each causal claim aka link.
- Usually, this quote will be a verbatim section of the text in a corresponding additional tab called `statements`, see above.

## Importing from other software

We are aware of the initiative to make qualitative coding software interoperable,Â [https://www.qdasoftware.org/products-project-exchange/](https://www.qdasoftware.org/products-project-exchange/). Causal Map has quite a different model and at the moment we donâ€™t provide this, but would do if there is a lot of interest.
