# Coding - creating factors and links

Qualitative causal mapping involves taking passages of text, e.g. from interviews or documents, and identifying sections which make causal claims. We highlight each of these sections and specify a causal factor at each end of each link (for example Lost job or Went hungry). This means creating a new factor or reusing an existing one. Usually we create these factors inductively as we code, and revise and review and consolidate them as part of the process, as with any other kind of qualitative content analysis. This section is about how to create factors and their labels.

In qualitative causal mapping, the central task is to identify factors and to formulate them in a way which is:

- easy to understand even without a lot of context
- concise (especially because the labels need to appear in maps)
- suitable for re-use in other causal links
- fits the intended interpretation of the causal links.

Formulating factor labels is a special case of formulating tags or categories in ordinary qualitative coding. For example some coding assignments are inductive, in which the aim is to identify factors as they emerge from reading the texts, whereas other tasks may be more or less deductive or confirmatory, in which a more or less fixed codebook is given in advance.

Choosing labels is particularly important when using Causal Map because the labels can do a lot of work for you:

- they can help “flag” the factor to make it easier to find
- they can help “flag” the factor to put it in a group with other factors
- they can express how a factor is “nested” within other factors.

In Causal Map, a factor *is* its label. Once you create a label, there is nothing else to add.

## 💻 Create and edit links in the app

Create and edit links


To code a causal link, - With your mouse, highlight a piece of text within the statement which makes a causal claim.

- Watch how that passage is copied for you into the “Quote” window below. (Usually you don't need to think about his window: you can edit the text if you really need to but it has to remain an exact quote of one part of the text or you will get a warning.) - Start to type the name of the influence factors at the **start** of the link(s) which you are going to make, in the first drop-down menu.

- If there is an existing factor which matches what you want, you can select select it.

- Otherwise you will create a new factor with the contents of what you have typed; finish what you have typed with a comma or a tab character if you want to continue to select or create another factor.

- If you want to create more than one link, you can select or create additional factors in the same box.

- When you have finished, press Enter.

- Repeat the process in the other box to specify the factors at the **end** of the link (or ends of the links).

- Press the green Save button which is now active.

- The link is created in the Map window, colour-coded with the quote which is now highlighted on the left. If you mouse over the highlighted quote, the link in the map is activated.

- Users with an 'Extra' subscription will see these two boxes: Pressing them adds '~' to the respective factors. This changes the meaning of the factor, for example ~raining is interpreted by the app as 'not raining'. This is allows for the creation of maps with positive (green) and negative (red) links.


To edit an existing link, - Click on it in the Interactive Map - Make any adjustments in the left panel, e.g. change the influence factor (in the first box), and/or the consequence factor (in the second box). You can change the quoted text just by re-highlighting the correct passage in the statement panel above in the same way that you made the original highlight.

- Press the green Save button.

**NOTE**: your factor names should not contain semicolons **;**. Semicolons are special, they are used for hierarchical coding.

After beginning to create links between factors, one will notice already-coded factors will appear in the dropdown menus in the to and from factor boxes. For added convenience, the most frequently coded factors will appear at the top of this list.

## Using memos and hashtags

Qualitative coding usually involves making notes and memos, and you can do this in Causal Map too.

Hashtags are available as a special kind of memo when coding a link: you can use them to provide any kind of additional information:

- where a link is only relevant in a particular context
- where a link is only a hypothesis
- where a link is only projected for the future
- to tag links you want to come back and review
- to add other qualifying information like “source seems unsure.”

As usual in Causal Map, you can apply one or more hashtags, and you can either select existing hashtags or create new ones on the fly.

Later, you can [filter the map](https://guide.causalmap.app/analysis.html#filtering-the-map-by-link-hashtag-memo) to show only links containing specific hashtags (or parts of hashtags), and also for links which do *not* contain specific hashtags or parts of hashtags.

## Formulating labels (semi-quantitative factors)

Remember that in general, factor names are case sensitive. So funding is **not the same as** Funding.

You can use emojis 😍 and other special characters in your factor labels.

Also, semi-colons ‘;’ you can use them if you want, but note that they have a special meaning in the app.

### Relax! Use heterogeneous, “in-vivo” factor labels

It might be tempting to try to formulate all factor labels in a strictly similar way, using for example language like “increased probability of …” or “positive change in …” in every case. But it is difficult to identify and agree on a satisfactory template for doing this which will capture enough of the way people really make causal explanations (in the way that quantitative social scientists hope to measure everything just with continuous variables). This is always a balancing act, but we encourage you when in doubt to stick fairly close to the actual language your sources use (so-called “in-vivo” coding), and don’t be *too* worried if your factor labels are different from one another grammatically (e.g. some express a difference like “improvement in X” and some do not.

The formulation of **factor labels** should fit the intended interpretation of the **causal links**. For example, most commonly B ➜ E is supposed to mean that B exerts in some sense an “increasing” or “decreasing” influence on E, then both B and E need to be formulated in a corresponding way. In order to ease interpretation, with a few exceptions, factors should be labelled and understood in such a way that it makes sense to say “more of this” or “this happened as opposed to not happening”: we call these semi-quantitative factors.

Consequently you should avoid a factor label like Training courses, which might be understood as a mixed bag of various causal factors to do with training courses. We would usually prefer a label such as Training courses delivered or Quality of training courses which are easier to understand as things which can increase or decrease, or happen or not happen. You may even prefer to use labels like Quality of training courses improved or Improved quality of training courses, in which the *difference made* is already included in the title.

### QuIP specific: back-chaining

In QuIP projects, most of the interview material comes in response to questions about changes in the reference period, usually the last three years. QuIP questioning continues back up the causal chain, asking what was the reason for that? … and the reason for that? That means that most influence factors will also be expressed as changes or differences (a change in F is explained by a change in E which is explained by a change in D….), whereas some are not (e.g. “unemployment”). Some analysts will try to avoid coding this kind of claim (can something which has been around a long time explain a change in the last three years?) but you may decide that this distinction does not matter too much. If something really does describe a *change* (e.g. “became unemployed”) then it should be coded.

Most QuIP testimony begins with questions about whether things have got better or worse, so most causal factors, going back up the causal chain, are likely to be semi-quantitative too.

### Examples of semi-quantitative factors

These are examples of factor labels where you can judge whether it happened more or less, whether it is higher or lower, or whether it happened versus not happened:

- Sold cow
- Earthquake happened
- (Had) good harvest
- (Level of) bank account
- (Level of) ethnic tolerance
- Quality of seeds

In some contexts, we can also talk about the *likelihood* of events, so “if people get a good harvest they are less likely to sell their cow.”

It is also perfectly acceptable and sometimes necessary to use purely qualitative labels, e.g. coping style, [see below](https://guide.causalmap.app/creating.html#examples-of-non-quantitative-factors). However, this may limit some of the analysis and reporting tools available.

## Opposed pairs of causal factors

What to do when some explanations use a causal factor phrased in a positive way and others use a similar causal factor but phrased the other way around?

“I feel good because my health is good.”

“My sister lost her job because her health is bad.”

We could code these:

Health improved ➜ Feel good

Health got worse ➜ Lost job

But we might feel we are missing the fact that the first factor in each case is arguably the same thing, just the other way around.

Solution 1: do nothing

This may mean you find yourself using pairs of opposing factors such as Better health and Worse health to capture the causal claims – things which are in a sense the opposite of one another. You might decide that is fine anyway, because you are happy to have pairs of factors like this, or because you decide that the pair of factors are not really polar opposites at all and therefore you don’t want to combine them. For example, illness is arguably not really simply the opposite of health but a quite different state with its own causal rules.

Solution 2: merge them

If you use more advanced coding styles involving “strength,” detailed in the “Extra” section of this Guide, you can avoid this by just using one factor like Better health.

Alternatively, ‘Health Improved’ and ‘Health got Worse’ could be coded as ‘Health Improved’ and ‘~Health Improved’ respectively, with ‘~’ indicating the ‘opposite’ of an improvement in health. The app will then treat links to Health Improved and ~Health Improved separately. [More information on this can be found here.](https://guide.causalmap.app/coding-opposites.html#combining-opposites)

## Formulating factors as desirable

If possible, especially when conducting evaluations or research for policy purposes, try to formulate these semi-quantitative factors so that for each one, *more* of it can be broadly thought of as *more desirable*, e.g. Health, Wellbeing; and failing that, as something *undesirable*, e.g. Psychosocial Stress, Mortality. Including factors which primarily code something undesirable as well as factors which primarily code something desirable, is often very natural, but you might sometimes have to think more carefully when making reports and summaries.

Again, it is least useful, but also perfectly acceptable and sometimes necessary, to fall back to using factor labels which are ambiguous as to their desirability, e.g. Moved house*,* if there is a lack of information or in the case of factors which simply are neutral.

## Examples of non-quantitative factors

These are examples of factors where it is very hard to quantify the occurrence in any way:

- Teaching style
- Coping strategy
- The content of the report

We call these non-quantitative factors. We might try to reword them as semi-quantitative factors like this:

- Helpfulness of teaching style
- Positiveness of report

The diagram below is an acceptable causal map, even though the intervening two variables are an example of more qualitative rather than (semi-)quantitative labels. It tells us that the training did something to the teaching style, which did something relevant to the learning style, which improved student outcomes. We don’t have a theory about the “how” of any of the arrows, and we don’t (necessarily) suggest that teaching style or learning style are things which can be measured on a single scale from e.g. “less” to “more.”

## Using flags in factor labels

Flags are just sequences of characters within a factor label to which you have given a special meaning, and which are unique and easy to search for. These can include letters, emojis or phrases. You can do coding without any such flags if you want, but it can help when searching and filtering.

A quote like “family is better off now because of improved food availability”

![https://guide.causalmap.app/_assets/image-20210109114200339.png](_assets/image-20210109114200339-16315605320862.png)

can be coded as a link from the causal factor:

(HN) More food

to the causal factor:

(RW) Improved wellbeing [P]

In this example, three optional flags have been used: the flags (HN) and (RW) are themes which these factors are associated with, [see later](https://guide.causalmap.app/creating.html#intervention-flags); and the flag [P] shows that this is a positive outcome. It is specifically marked as desirable.

Flags like "difficulty*" or “#problem” are good as the additional symbol makes them unique. A flag like “men” is not suitable because it is likely to appear elsewhere (e.g. as part of “women” or “management”).

### Intervention Flags

The commissioner of an evaluation will nearly always want to be able to focus on their own interventions, so it is advisable to use a consistent label or category across all factors which are noted as project inputs in order to be easily searchable. These will usually be influence factors with no parents, i.e. factors which have no incoming influence factors.

In the example below, both are similar interventions, but one is clearly attributable to an NGO.

“MSF gave us medicines which healed the children”

MSF gave medicines –> children healed

“Someone gave us medicines which healed the children”

Unknown actor gave medicines –> children healed

You have a range of options to flag this difference in the label and enable you to filter for all project-related interventions once the data is coded.

· All such interventions can be labelled with the NGO’s name

· If you are doing nested coding, you can nest such factors within a higher-level factor like ‘Interventions;’

· And/or you can use a specific intervention flag, e.g. #Intervention. (QuIP has its own flags, [I] for Implicit and [E] for Explicit).

You can use any label you want as long as you are sure it is unique, it doesn’t appear accidentally in other factor names, and you use it consistently.

### Outcome Flags

Similarly, if you wish to flag up outcomes /consequences as either desired/desirable/valued, or the inverse, you can mark these in a way which makes them easy to identify. You could use symbols like ♥ etc. in the labels to designate this, or use use QuIP-style labels [P] for positive and [N] for negative. This can be helpful when undertaking analysis; for example, displaying direct and indirect links from some or all of the intervention factors to some or all of the positive outcome factors or highlighting or counting paths leading to all negative outcome factors, etc.

Again, you can use any label you want as long as you are sure it is unique, it doesn’t appear accidentally in other factor names, and you use it consistently.

### Coding your statements in context: referring to evidence from elsewhere

When coding data from an interview it is very important to see the whole interview as your source, and not fall into the trap of only coding the statement in front you, out of context. If your statements are split into separate questions (as is often the case with QuIP), it can be misleading to code just one statement in isolation, without taking account of what the respondent says earlier or later in the interview. For this reason we recommend that all analysts read the whole interview before starting to code, and start to formulate causal stories which fit across the whole interview. In some cases, you may prefer to have the whole interview as one statement, and to code it all in one place. This is absolutely possible, and just depends how the data is imported (whatever information is on one row in the .csv file is considered a statement). If, however, the interview is too long, or you would still prefer to code question by question, you need may want to refer to information provided in another statement when coding a link. This is not necessary but can be useful when sharing the file with a commissioner who may look at quotes associated with links, and not understand the rationale for coding without further context. The same applies for different parts of a paragraphs within one statement; you may want to highlight two separate parts of a longer statement.

If the quote is not exactly verbatim in the statement, the app won’t let you save anything. (If this happens, just cancel the quote (press the X) and start again.) The app is really picky about this to ensure your quotes are accurate. However, this rule does not apply for anything between square brackets, a useful feature for this case. If the evidence for a link is mentioned in two different parts of a single statement, like this:

*Yes, we got the help from OrgX. Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo. And because of that help, now I have a job. qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit. Ut enim ad minima veniam.*

You can use square brackets to remove the text you don’t want. Highlight the whole piece of text you want to code, and then edit the quote in the quote window, replacing what you don’t need with […]

*Yes, we got the help from OrgX. […] And because of that help, now I have a job.*

Be careful not to introduce any new text or even spaces.

You can also use the same technique to add your own comment or quote from a statement elsewhere in the interview:

*[this is my note] Neque porro quisquam est, qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit, sed quia non numquam eius modi tempora incidunt.*

Ellipses are also helpful to refer to another statement as part of your evidence:

*[reference to statement 36: The whole village received help from Org X] Thanks to that help we received, we are now growing our own produce.*

## Consolidating and editing factor labels

After you have created more than about 50 factors you will probably feel the need to start consolidating and renaming them and perhaps merging some.

If you look at the Mentions table in the app, you will probably find a lot of *pairs* of factors each of which is used only once, as half of this particular pair, and don’t appear linked into longer stories. We almost certainly will want to consolidate some of these factors by in some way merging them with others which have similar meaning.

Suppose you have 100 factors which are just mentioned once or twice. It’s a lot of work to do all that coding, a lot of work for almost nothing, because those very infrequent factors (we call them “tiddlers”) are unlikely to appear much in any reporting you do. With hierarchical coding, even infrequent factors can contribute to the bigger picture.

Before we even think about consolidating factors, do remember the golden rule that, **when coding a new link, always look at your existing factors and try selecting one of those before creating a new one.** Even if you think an existing factor isn’t quite a perfect fit, you can use it and adjust the factor name later. Ideally you will always be able to think of labels for your factors which are at least general enough to cover a few different cases.

It can be helpful to reformulate factor labels so that some common themes come *first*:

- “communication difficulties - intercultural”
- “communication difficulties - lack of internet”

This is useful when the factors are listed alphabetically and can be a stepping-stone to formulating factors hierarchically.

Even when doing inductive coding, some people formulate factors with a theory in mind, with some higher-level factors like “communication difficulties” or “resilient outcomes.” However we have found that it is often most interesting when you let the theory emerge rather than by starting with a preconceived template in this way. Look at your factors periodically as you code and see if there are any obvious groups.

Also, our recommended way of having your cake and eating it - keeping the detail but seeing the general trends too – is “hierarchical coding.” [See below](https://guide.causalmap.app/creating.html#simplifying-causal-maps-with-hierarchical-coding).

### Recoding / merging multiple factors into one

In some cases you will simply decide, in the face of too many factors, to merge

Engagement with communities

and

NGO engagement

… into one, e.g. Engagement.

If you have two factors like this which are very similar but not quite the same, you can sometimes keep some detail by using a composite label which explicitly mentions both:

Engagement with communities/NGOs

### 🖥 How to do this in the app?

### Editing factor labels in the Factor Editor

Click inside the editor and retype the factor labels however you want. You can rewrite entire lines, but you can't delete or add lines.

Then hit Update.

**TIP**: press Ctrl F (Cmd F on Mac) to find or Ctrl H (Cmd alt F on Mac) to replace.

**TIP**: Reformulate factor labels so that some common themes come *first*.

**TIP**: Use flags like “Problem!” or “#innovation”, unique words which are easy to search for, to make it easy to find particular kinds of factor within the editor and elsewhere.

**TIP**: Merge your factors. You have two or more factors which are more or less the same?

- pick the best version, tweak it if necessary, and then copy the whole line
- go to one of the other versions, and replace the label with the label you copied, taking care not to delete or add lines
- repeat with any other similar lines, so that all the similar labels are now exactly the same
- don't forget to press Update!
- … these factors with the common label will all be combined into one

## Splitting/recoding existing factors: Use the **Split** switch.


Usually when you rename your factors, the names change everywhere. If you switch on “Split”, each factor you rename will be split into a new factor (with the new name which is used only for the links in the current view/filter), and the original factor which is unchanged. This is useful for example if you find you have merged some ideas together too quickly into one factor and you want to split it back into two.

Suppose you have coded both “I bought a cow”“ and "I bought a sheep” as *bought livestock* and then you change your mind, you can go back to the statement with “I bought a cow”, and in this tab you switch on “Split” and recode *bought livestock* back to *bought cow*. If you didn't switch on “Split”, the other quote (“I bought a sheep”) would also be recoded as *bought cow*, which isn't what you want.

Bear in mind that if you merge several factors into one, this may mean you get duplicate or triplicate links between the same pairs of factors.

## Advanced editing tips

- Go to the next mention of a selected word/sentence: **Ctrl K,or Cmd G on Mac**. Add SHIFT to these shortcuts to find the *previous* mention.
- Add next occurrence of selected word/sentence to multi-selection: **Ctrl-Alt-Right,or Cmd-Option-Right on Mac**. Use **Ctrl-Alt-Left / Cmd-Option-Left** to add *previous* occurrence.
- The app will help you consistently type words you have already used with autocomplete. Or just ignore it if you want.
- Multicursor: Ctr alt Up/Down: edit multiple lines at once
