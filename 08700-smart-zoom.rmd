Assuming we have a causal map which has used nested coding, as in the small map shown above, how do we take advantage of this coding to ‚Äúzoom out‚Äù? 

Here is the same map, zoomed out to level 1 (i.e. there are no semi-colons at all).

A weakness of hierarchical zooming is already visible in the example, so simplification goes one step further. In many cases we may be happy to see all the factors ‚Äúrolled up‚Äù to the top level but in the above example, ‚ÄúHealth behaviour; hand washing‚Äù dominates. ‚ÄúHealth behaviour‚Äù itself is only mentioned once in the raw data, and there is only one other mention of it as a higher-level component, in relation to vaccinations. What can we do about this? 

Another way to simplify a causal map is just to hide factors and/or links which are mentioned less frequently. Often it is hard to view a full causal map, especially because of the presence of very many of what we could call ‚Äútiddlers‚Äù: factors with just one or two mentions. But this is unsatisfactory because it throws away information. This won‚Äôt help us, but can we combine the two approaches?

A smarter approach is achievable with this simple algorithm: only "roll up" a nested factor into a higher-level factor if it has a frequency (simple frequency, or source count) lower than some cut-off value; otherwise, keep it separate. 

This is an improvement over zooming because it retains detail where it is necessary and removes it where it is not. It will roll up lots of infrequent, granular factors into their parents but only if they are infrequent; if you have a very granular factor like "health behaviour; hand washing" which actually has a lot of mentions, then it won't get rolled up. 

The above example can be rolled up to this:

This is an improvement because it still has a small number of factors, retaining frequently-mentioned factors but wrapping up infrequently-mentioned detail into higher-level concepts. 

This isn't available using the buttons yet but you can use the Advanced Editor. The code is:

```
zoom factors level=1 preserve_frequency = 5
```

You can use source_count instead:

```
zoom factors level=1 preserve_frequency = 5 frequency_field = source_count
```

There is also a shortcut button to insert the most common filter for you:

One thing which is not yet clear is whether the resulting pair of factors "Health behaviour" and "Health behaviour; hand_washing" should be distinguished in any way. For example, perhaps it isn't obvious, looking at "Health behaviour", that this higher-level factor *excludes* in this case its actual daughter,  "Health behaviour; Hand washing".

What the app does provide is the additional field in the factors table: `frequency preserved` . So if you want, you can highlight factors which are not rolled up, for example like this:

```
color borders field="frequency_preserved" hi=red lo=white
```

Here is a real-life example. 

A top-level map, zoomed out to level 1 (source counts are shown). As you can see this map is quite simple with no additional details.

And here is the same map but preserving factors with a source count above 5. This seems like a real improvement as some really concrete and important second-level factors are preserved, including for example that the training mentioned on 6 occasions was agricultural training and that fertiliser was mentioned as a driver of change. 

The factors with a purple border have been ‚Äòrolled up‚Äô and only their top-level label is visible. The other factors have been preserved and are displayed in full, as they have a frequency count higher than 5 or because they are a level one label and so cannot be ‚Äòrolled up‚Äô.

Probably the best way to do this is to add "(other)", or whatever else you type, on to the ends of the higher-level factor labels which have larger child factors elsewhere in the map. Larger child factors are those which are *not* rolled up because they are so frequent, like 'New agricultural inputs; Fertiliser' in the below map. To do this add `frequency_other= (other)` in the advanced editor on the same line as your commands to preserve factors whilst zooming. This will create a map like below:
