  abstract = {TITLE Measuring exposure to racism: Development and validation of a Race-Related Stressor Scale (RRSS) for Asian American Vietnam veterans. ABSTRACT This article describes the development and validation of the Race-Related Stressor Scale (RRSS), a questionnaire that assesses exposure to race-related stressors in the military and war zone. Validated on a sample of 300 Asian American Vietnam veterans, the RRSS has high internal consistency and adequate temporal stability. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that exposure to race-related stressors accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and general psychiatric symptoms, over and above (by 20\% and 19\%, respectively) that accounted for by combat exposure and military rank. The RRSS appears to be a psychometrically sound measure of exposure to race-related stressors for this population. Race-related stressors as measured by the RRSS appear to contribute uniquely and substantially to PTSD symptoms and generalized psychiatric distress.

  abstract = {The paper launches a normative debate on an under-assessed health policy problem, namely post-war mental health. It explores its ethical dimensions and argues for a strong moral claim to invest in it as a form of reparation that must be added to the jus post-bellum's truncated list of recommendations. Many countries are currently involved in armed conflict and many more still recovering from past wars. These generally belong to the low-to-middle income group that spend minimally on social and health expenditures.The problem worsens post-war for these countries are burdened with an increased prevalence of mental health disorders with far-reaching repercussions. Failure to recognize in particular war-related psychosocial sequels could weaken capacity to recover and may contribute to a nation's socio-political unrest that could perpetuate throughout generations. The paper argues that reconstructing war-torn societies should be achieved by rebuilding first and foremost the shattered individual. Policy-makers have a stronger positive obligation to invest in post-war mental health because of a shared responsibility for the harm inflicted. This consequently means a shared responsibility in building a sustainable and viable post-war minimally just state'.The paper draws on Pogge's relational conceptions of justice' and the concept of shared responsibility' used in contemporary environmental discourses. It challenges the old paradigmatic model of the just-war tradition which views the world as an archipelagos of well-delineated, self-contained and atomized actors. It also aims to set the stage for an ethics of post-war mental health' in line with what Ricoeur calls an ethics of memory'.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The West African Ebola epidemic has demonstrated that the existing range of medical and epidemiological responses to emerging disease outbreaks is insufficient, especially in post-conflict contexts with exceedingly poor healthcare infrastructures. In this context, community-based responses have proven vital for containing Ebola virus disease (EVD) and shifting the epidemic curve. Despite a surge in interest in local innovations that effectively contained the epidemic, the mechanisms for community-based response remain unclear. This study provides baseline information on community-based epidemic control priorities and identifies innovative local strategies for containing EVD in Liberia.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This study was conducted in September 2014 in 15 communities in Monrovia and Montserrado County, Liberia\textendash one of the epicenters of the Ebola outbreak. Findings from 15 focus group discussions with 386 community leaders identified strategies being undertaken and recommendations for what a community-based response to Ebola should look like under then-existing conditions. Data were collected on the following topics: prevention, surveillance, care-giving, community-based treatment and support, networks and hotlines, response teams, Ebola treatment units (ETUs) and hospitals, the management of corpses, quarantine and isolation, orphans, memorialization, and the need for community-based training and education. Findings have been presented as community-based strategies and recommendations for (1) prevention, (2) treatment and response, and (3) community sequelae and recovery. Several models for community-based management of the current Ebola outbreak were proposed. Additional findings indicate positive attitudes towards early Ebola survivors, and the need for community-based psychosocial support.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Local communities' strategies and recommendations give insight into how urban Liberian communities contained the EVD outbreak while navigating the systemic failures of the initial state and international response. Communities in urban Liberia adapted to the epidemic using multiple coping strategies. In the absence of health, infrastructural and material supports, local people engaged in self-reliance in order to contain the epidemic at the micro-social level. These innovations were regarded as necessary, but as less desirable than a well-supported health-systems based response; and were seen as involving considerable individual, social, and public health costs, including heightened vulnerability to infection.},

Responding to this call, this paper offers an exposition of a causal mapping technique. In the project management literature, there already exists a small number of articles reporting effective use of causal mapping. However, these are not dedicated to detailed explanation of the technique itself and so lack consideration of its features beyond those relevant to a particular application. Consequently, an exposition of the technique is needed to enable comprehensive understanding of causal mapping to be gained and its suitability for research designs assessed. Specifically, this paper examines causal mapping's theoretical grounding, explores its strengths and weakness, presents example applications, compares alternative causal mapping approaches, and overall, explains how causal mapping can support a systemic perspective on projects. These issues will be of interest to researchers who wish to incorporate causal mapping into their project management research designs.},

"Three of Kelly's corollaries strongly influence the approach. These are individuality (recognising individuals interpret events in unique ways), commonality (the development of a common language through shared understanding of the different interpretations) and sociality (agreement based on a shared understanding towards a common outcome" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PX3ECD2R?page=2}{Ackermann and Alexander 2016:892})

"As can be seen, using a nomothetic approach, the resultant map tends to contain a) briefer (fewer words), b) a smaller number of statements and c) fewer relationships linking the nodes. In short, data tend to be far less abundant in a nomothetic map than in an idiographic map. As a consequence, meaning and thus clarity of understanding are impeded. (Eden and Ackermann, 1998a).

  abstract = {As evidenced through both a historical and contemporary number of reported over-runs, managing projects can be a risky business. Managers are faced with the need to effectively work with a multitude of parties and deal with a wealth of interlocking uncertainties. This paper describes a modelling process developed to assist managers facing such situations. The process helps managers to develop a comprehensive appreciation of risks and gain an understanding of the impact of the interactions between these risks through explicitly engaging a wide stakeholder base using a group support system and causal mapping process. Using a real case the paper describes the modelling process and outcomes along with its implications, before reflecting on the insights, limitations and future research. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This article defines social resilience as the ability of groups or communities to cope with external stresses and disturbances as a result of social, political and environmental change. This definition highlights social resilience in relation to the concept of ecological resilience which is a characteristic of ecosystems to maintain themselves in the face of disturbance. There is a clear link between social and ecological resilience, particularly for social groups or communities that are dependent on ecological and environmental resources for their livelihoods. But it is not clear whether resilient ecosystems enable resilient communities in such situations. This article examines whether resilience is a useful characteristic for describing the social and economic situation of social groups and explores potential links between social resilience and ecological resilience. The origins of this interdisciplinary study in human ecology, ecological economics and rural sociology are reviewed, and a study of the impacts of ecological change on a resource-dependent community in contemporary coastal Vietnam in terms of the resilience of its institutions is outlined.},

An integrative Person x Situation model is developed based on the literature that specifies the nature of interactions among five classes of variables: (a) personality, (b) affect regulation, (c) coping, (d) ego defenses, and (e) the utilization and mobilization of protective factors and resources to aid coping.}

  abstract = {Despite recent successes of reinforcement learning (RL), it remains a challenge for agents to transfer learned skills to related environments. To facilitate research addressing this problem, we propose CausalWorld, a benchmark for causal structure and transfer learning in a robotic manipulation environment. The environment is a simulation of an open-source robotic platform, hence offering the possibility of sim-to-real transfer. Tasks consist of constructing 3D shapes from a given set of blocks - inspired by how children learn to build complex structures. The key strength of CausalWorld is that it provides a combinatorial family of such tasks with common causal structure and underlying factors (including, e.g., robot and object masses, colors, sizes). The user (or the agent) may intervene on all causal variables, which allows for fine-grained control over how similar different tasks (or task distributions) are. One can thus easily define training and evaluation distributions of a desired difficulty level, targeting a specific form of generalization (e.g., only changes in appearance or object mass). Further, this common parametrization facilitates defining curricula by interpolating between an initial and a target task. While users may define their own task distributions, we present eight meaningful distributions as concrete benchmarks, ranging from simple to very challenging, all of which require long-horizon planning as well as precise low-level motor control. Finally, we provide baseline results for a subset of these tasks on distinct training curricula and corresponding evaluation protocols, verifying the feasibility of the tasks in this benchmark.},

  abstract = {Research dealing with various aspects of the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, 1987) is reviewed, and some unresolved issues are discussed. In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability. \textcopyright{} 1991.},

It is found that social capital, a complex and compound construct, can be both an asset and a liability with respect to mental health of those in receipt of and those providing services and other interventions. The most meaningful assessment of social capital or components thereof may examine individual access to rather than possession of social capital, a property of groups, and therefore an ecological variable. Theoretical advances in research on social capital serve to identify mainly two types of social capital: bonding (between individuals in a group) and bridging (between groups). Each type of social capital has cognitive and/or structural component(s) and may operate at micro and/or macro level(s). Effective mental health policy and service provision may build or strengthen bridging social capital and benefit from both bonding and bridging social capital where either or both exist. Established indicators of social capital are amenable to quantitative and qualitative assessment, preferably in tandem. However studies that employ combined research design are rare or non-existent. Interdisciplinary multi-method investigations and analyses are called for in order to unravel mechanisms whereby social capital and mental health might be meaningfully associated.},

  author = {{ALNAP}},
  year = {2006},
  abstract = {The ALNAP Review of Humanitarian Action has been monitoring the quality of evaluations of humanitarian action for the past five years. The positive news is that evaluations have become more deeply ingrained in the humanitarian sector. The not-so-good news is that the quality of the evaluations themselves still leaves much to be desired. The development of better evaluations is not just an end in itself: high-quality evaluations should have a positive effect on improving learning, accountability and performance in the sector. When the Joint Evaluation of Emergency Assistance to Rwanda was undertaken in 1995, there were no manuals, guidelines or good practice notes to follow on evaluating humanitarian action. Since then, some helpful materials have been published notably Evaluating Humanitarian Assistance Programmes in Complex Emergencies (Hallam, 1998) and Guidance for Evaluating Humanitarian Assistance in Complex Emergencies (OECD-DAC, 1999). The first of these texts was aimed at evaluators, while the second was intended for commissioning agencies. This new ALNAP guide builds on the achievement of both publications by providing a framework designed to assist with the interpretation of key DAC criteria within a specifically humanitarian context. This will be of value to both evaluators and evaluation managers alike. Evaluation teams in the field piloted draft versions of this guide, and the practical lessons learned from those experiences have been incorporated into this final version. I believe that this process has helped to create a guide that is user-friendly and will be an excellent tool for designers of evaluations and for the teams on the ground. Alongside other activities to improve evaluation, such as the ALNAP meta-evaluation and ALNAP evaluation training modules, this guide signals how far the evaluation community has come in pursuing quality in evaluation as a means of improving humanitarian performance. With other recent initiatives on evaluation quality and standards by both DAC and the UN, there are good grounds for expecting further improvements in the future.},

To better understand the spread of infection in the affected countries, it is crucial to know the number of secondary cases generated by an infected index case in the absence and presence of control measures, i.e., the basic and effective reproduction number. In this study, I describe the EBOV epidemic using an SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model and fit the model to the most recent reported data of infected cases and deaths in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. The maximum likelihood estimates of the basic reproduction number are 1.51 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.50-1.52) for Guinea, 2.53 (95\% CI: 2.41-2.67) for Sierra Leone and 1.59 (95\% CI: 1.57-1.60) for Liberia. The model indicates that in Guinea and Sierra Leone the effective reproduction number might have dropped to around unity by the end of May and July 2014, respectively. In Liberia, however, the model estimates no decline in the effective reproduction number by end-August 2014. This suggests that control efforts in Liberia need to be improved substantially in order to stop the current outbreak.},

The present review summarizes the current state of genetic research on PTSD. First, we outline information regarding genetic influences provided by family investigations and by twin studies. Second, we propose the fear-conditioning model of PTSD as a framework for the nomination of candidate genes that may be related to the disorder. Third, we review lines of evidence from three neurobiological systems involved in fear conditioning, and we summarize published investigations of genetic variants studied in association with PTSD in these three systems. Finally, we review gene-by-environment interaction research, a promising novel approach to genetic research in PTSD.}

This paper first describes the key similarities and differences between economic evaluation and realist evaluation. It summarises what health economists see as the challenges of evaluating complex interventions, and their suggested solutions. We then use examples of programme theory from a recent realist review of shared care for chronic conditions to illustrate two ways in which realist evaluations might better capture the resource requirements and resource consequences of programmes, and thereby produce explanations of how they are linked to outcomes (i.e. explanations of cost-effectiveness).},

  abstract = {Objective: Since the diagnosis of delayed-onset posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was introduced in DSM-III, there has been controversy over its prevalence and even its existence. The authors sought to resolve discrepant findings concerning the prevalence of delayed-onset PTSD by conducting a systematic review of the evidence. Method: A literature search was conducted for case reports and group studies with adequate measurement of delayed-onset PTSD according to DSM criteria. Studies that met inclusion criteria were examined for the defined length of delay for delayed-onset PTSD, presence of symptoms before full diagnostic criteria were met, length of follow-up, prevalence estimates, and other variables. Studies were also examined for differences between immediate-onset PTSD, delayed-onset PTSD, and no-PTSD cases. Results: Ten case studies and 19 group studies met criteria for inclusion in the review. Studies consistently showed that delayed-onset PTSD in the absence of any prior symptoms was rare, whereas delayed onsets that represented exacerbations or reactivations of prior symptoms accounted on average for 38.2\% and 15.3\%, respectively, of military and civilian cases of PTSD. Conclusions: The discrepant findings in the literature concerning prevalence can be largely, but not completely, explained as being due to definitional issues. Little is known about what distinguishes the delayed- onset and immediate-onset forms of the disorder. Continuing scientific study of delayed-onset PTSD would benefit if future editions of DSM were to adopt a definition that explicitly accepts the likelihood of at least some prior symptoms.

This approach is considered especially suitable for complex interventions. We question this assumption and argue that ToC's focus on cause\textendash effect logic and intended out- comes does not do justice to the recursive nature of complex interventions such as advocacy. Supported by our work as evaluators, and specifically our case study of an advocacy program on child rights, we illustrate how advocacy evolves through recursive interactions, with outcomes that are emergent rather than predictable. We propose putting ``practices of change'' at the center by emphasizing human interactions, using the analytical lenses of strategies as practice and recursive- ness. This provides room for emergent outcomes and implies a different use of ToC. In this article, we make a clear distinction between theoretical reality models and the real world of practices.

In some instances specific assets were cited such as 'employment' (Cutter, 2010) while in others more general statements were made, such as 'has social assets' (Mayunga, 2007). \textbullet{} Access to external resources: These emphasised the importance of being able to access external resources (i.e. resources that are outside of the community and where the community only had limited or minimal control.)

  abstract = {Climate change poses a significant threat to Africa, and deforestation rates have increased in recent years. Mitigation initiatives such as REDD+ are widely considered as potentially efficient ways to generate emission reductions (or removals), conserve or sustainably manage forests, and bring benefits to communities, but effective implementation models are lacking. This paper presents the case of Ghana's Community Resource Management Area (CREMA) mechanism, an innovative natural resource governance and landscape-level planning tool that authorizes communities to manage their natural resources for economic and livelihood benefits. This paper argues that while the CREMA was originally developed to facilitate community-based wildlife management and habitat protection, it offers a promising community-based structure and process for managing African forest resources for REDD+. At a theoretical level, it conforms to the ecological, socio-cultural and economic factors that drive resource-users' decision process and practices. And from a practical mitigation standpoint, the CREMA has the potential to help solve many of the key challenges for REDD+ in Africa, including definition of boundaries, smallholder aggregation, free prior and informed consent, ensuring permanence, preventing leakage, clarifying land tenure and carbon rights, as well as enabling equitable benefit-sharing arrangements. Ultimately, CREMA's potential as a forest management and climate change mitigation strategy that generates livelihood benefits for smallholder farmers and forest users will depend upon the willingness of African governments to support the mechanism and give it full legislative backing, and the motivation of communities to adopt the CREMA and integrate democratic decision-making and planning with their traditional values and natural resource management systems.},

  abstract = {The skills gap is an ever-present reality for most organizations. Demographic shifts in the workforce, the globalization of human capital, educational attainment lagging the need for skills, and the impact that the global recession has had on organizations of all sizes and in all sectors mean senior executives are facing real challenges when it comes to managing the skills gap in their organizations. In fact a 2009 ASTD Skills Gap poll taken by 1,179 organizations found that 79 percent reported a skills gap in their organization. ASTD defines a skills gap as a significant gap between an organization's current capabilities and the skills it needs to achieve its goals. It is the point at which an organization can no longer grow or remain competitive because it cannot fill critical jobs with employees who have the right knowledge, skills, and abilities. In reality, organizations will always experience a skills gap if they are staying ahead of shifting conditions in their environment and changing expectations from their constituents, shareholders, or customers. The key to achieving success under such circumstances is to harness skilled talent to strategy and goals\textemdash a task that has become more and more challenging in an increasingly global, virtual, and changing world. This Infoline provides background for understanding the skills gap and an action plan for taking charge of it. The plan delineates six steps and their processes that can help leaders, managers, and learning professionals assess whether a skills gap exists and, if so, how to successfully manage it within their organizations. Companies, that successfully implemented these steps, share case studies so that their best practices can help you think creatively about solutions to tackle a skills gap in your organization.},

  author = {{Associated Press}},
  year = {2014},
  abstract = {DAKAR, Senegal \textemdash{} The Ebola outbreak ravaging West Africa is ``totally out of control,'' according to a senior official for Doctors Without Borders, who says the medical group is stretched to the limit in responding. The outbreak has caused more deaths than any other of the disease, said another official with the medical charity. Ebola has been linked to more than 330 deaths in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, according to the World Health Organization. International organizations and the governments involved need to send in more health experts and increase public education messages about how to stop the spread of the disease, Bart Janssens, the director of operations for the medical group in Brussels, told The Associated Press on Friday. ADVERTISEMENT ``The reality is clear that the epidemic is now in a second wave,'' Janssens said. ``And, for me, it is totally out of control.'' The Ebola virus, which causes internal bleeding and organ failure, spreads through direct contact with infected people. There is no cure or vaccine, so containing an outbreak focuses on supportive care for the ill and isolating them to limit the spread of the virus. The current outbreak, which began in Guinea either late last year or early this year, had appeared to slow before picking up pace again in recent weeks, including spreading to the Liberian capital for the first time. ``This is the highest outbreak on record and has the highest number of deaths, so this is unprecedented so far,'' said Armand Sprecher, a public health specialist with Doctors Without Borders. According to the WHO, the highest previous death toll was in the first recorded Ebola outbreak in Congo in 1976, when 280 deaths were reported. Because Ebola often touches remote areas and the first cases sometimes go unrecognized, it is likely that there are deaths that go uncounted during outbreaks. The multiple locations of the current outbreak and its movement across borders make it one of the ``most challenging Ebola outbreaks ever,'' Fadela Chaib, a spokeswoman for the World Health Organization, said earlier in the week. But Janssens' description of the Ebola outbreak was even more alarming, and he warned that the countries involved had not recognized the gravity of the situation. He criticized WHO for not doing enough to prod local leaders; the U.N. health agency did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ``There needs to be a real political commitment that this is a very big emergency,'' he said. ``Otherwise, it will continue to spread, and for sure it will spread to more countries.'' ADVERTISEMENT But Tolbert Nyenswah, Liberia's deputy minister of health, said the highest levels of government are working to contain the outbreak, noting that Liberia had a long period with no new cases before this second wave. Governments and international agencies are definitely struggling to keep up with the outbreak, said Unni Krishnan of Plan International, which is providing equipment to the three countries. But he noted that the disease is striking in one of the world's poorest regions, where public health systems are already fragile. With more than 40 international staff currently on the ground and four treatment centers, Doctors Without Borders has reached its limit to respond, Janssens said. It is unclear, for instance, if the group will be able to set up a treatment center in Liberia, like the ones it is running in in Guinea and Sierra Leone, he said. Janssens said the only way to stop the disease's spread is to persuade people to come forward when symptoms occur and to avoid touching the sick and dead. He said this outbreak is particularly challenging because it began in an area where people are very mobile and has spread to even more densely populated areas, like the capitals of Guinea and Liberia. The disease typically strikes sparsely populated areas in central or eastern Africa, where it spreads less easily, he said. By contrast, the epicenter of this outbreak is near a major regional transport hub, the Guinean city of Gueckedou.

RESULTS: In the observed period, 8.329 of patients in the outpatient care program were included, 617 of inpatients were treated in the Clinic, while 301 of patients in the Partial hospitalization program were included. Mean +/- standard deviation of patients' age was 45+/-8.06 years. More psychotraumatized women (60.8\%) were encompassed in the partial hospitalization program than in inpatients (23.9\%) or outpatients (18.3\%) care programs. In regard of trauma related mental disorders, majority outpatients had Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in co morbidity with other mental disorders (72.5\%), PTSD was presented amongst the majority of inpatients (64.5\%) and in partial hospitalization program there were (47.5\%) patients with PTSD. CONCLUSIONS: In the treatment of psychotraumatized persons, in the organizing of health care system schema in postwar Bosnia and Herzegovina, meaningful obstacles are presented still today on the both, social and political level, despite mental health service reform performed in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The stigmatization of mental health issues is an important problem in treatment of traumatized individuals especially among war veterans. The lack a single Center for psychotrauma in postwar BH shows absence of political will in BH to resolve the problem of war veterans with trauma related psychological disorders.},

  note = {``It is shown how a person might use his cognitive map to derive explanations of the past, make predictions for the future, and choose policies in the present.'' Cognitive maps can be normative or empirical. The rules are intended to be rational, so one could naively expect people to actually make the choices which they ought to make. The factors or concepts are treated as variables, and the "causal assertions" are treated as relationships between the variables. The approach treads a fine line between treating the links as facts about the world and as facts about what someone thinks about the world. All the examples given of types of concept (continuous, ordinal, dichotomous) are what we call ``semi-quantitative''. A special type of concept is a utility variable, e.g. benefit for the actor. Links or arrows can be positive (``augments'') or negative (``inhibits''). Establishes what are by now well-established rules for causal maps. Shows how to combine the effects of a longer path into a single effect. The indirect effect of a path is negative if and only if it has an odd number of negative sections. A map is ``imbalanced'' if there is a pair of paths with opposite direct effects, and otherwise balanced. Explicitly calculates the total effect as the sum of indirect effects. Inference rules: uses the notion of ``utility variables'' to conclude that those policies which have a positive total effect on utility should be adopted, and otherwise rejected, in particular by producing a sub-map including all and only the paths leading to utility variables. Also shows how to make predictions and explanations, and answer strategic questions (what would happen if the map was changed in some way)? Also discusses cycles, positive and negative feedback etc. Discusses cognitive maps which model with rational numbers, but also promotes the advantages of simpler maps with links which can be only positive or negative.

"A person's beliefs can be regarded as a complex system.

This is the first chapter in the book. Uses the term "cognitive map" but all these maps are explicitly causal. "This is a book about how people make decisions and how they can make better decisions". The task is to encode public assertions and behaviour, not private beliefs. Analyses how policy interventions can influence valued goals and how to cope with relatively complicated sets of causal information. Aim of establishing a (better) formalised system for decision problems. Gives our consensus definition of causal map (points joined by arrows which encode causality), calling it a cognitive map. Arrows encode positive or negative links. "the cognitive map would have to be derivable from whatever materials are left behind in the normal course of a decision-making process." But also discusses gathering data via interview and questionnaire. Explicitly discusses inference rules. A map has to be amenable to evaluation - to check it against reality. Maps have to be coded in a reliable and accurate way. Claims interrater reliability similar to that for quantitative studies. The book presents five empirical studies, modelling actual decision problems which are tested against reality in various ways, including making predictions and suggesting interventions. One of these compares maps of the same area from different sources and discusses how background variables like nationality are related to differences in the maps.},

Participatory Systems Mapping involves the production of a causal map of a system by a diverse set of stakeholders. The map, once refined and validated, can be analysed and used in a variety of ways in an evaluation or in evaluation planning. The analysis approach combines network analysis with subjective information from stakeholders. We suggest Participatory Systems Mapping shows great potential to offer value to evaluators due to the unique insights it offers, the relative ease of its use, and its complementarity with existing evaluation approaches and methods.},

Food security policy decision-makers need to take account of these factors and their interdependencies using available data and experts judgements. Dy-namic Bayesian networks are powerful models that are able to capture the dependencies between variables and combine data with expert opinion in a rigorous fashion as they develop over time. They have been shown to be appropriate for various types of decision support; however their applica-tion to food security policy is novel.

This chapter contributes to the literature by identifying behavioral mechanisms generated through engagement with climate-resilient agriculture interventions within a larger livelihood project in Ethiopia. It works through the steps that enabled the study to unpack the black box between the climate-smart interventions and the outcome of crop production. The first step was a matching-based sampling design, following households over 3 years with six biannual surveys, and setting up a quasi-experimental evaluation setting. The second step used the data generated from the surveys in difference-in-difference models to assess the impact of the intervention on crop production. Third, to gain insight into the mechanisms at work, Focus Group Discussions (FGD) were conducted with smallholder farmer project beneficiaries. The FGDs revealed what the beneficiaries themselves considered the key mechanisms generated from the intervention, thus forming the bridge between the interventions and outcome. The result was an evaluation design enabling deeper insight into attribution claims. The findings offered novel insights for policymakers about how the climate-resilient interventions worked for the people themselves and shedding light on the inner workings of the climate-smart technologies. Finally, they provided key stakeholders (commissioning agency and implementing organizations) with a powerful means by which to learn about the last project, so to better plan for the next iteration and improve the climate resilience of smallholder farmers.},

  abstract = {Context Although impunity for those responsible for trauma is widely thought to be associated with psychological problems in survivors of political violence, no study has yet investigated this issue. Objective To examine the mental health and cognitive effects of war trauma and how appraisal of redress for trauma and beliefs about justice, safety, other people, war cause, and religion relate to posttraumatic stress responses in war survivors. Design, Setting, and Participants A cross-sectional survey conducted between March 2000 and July 2002 with a population-based sample of 1358 war survivors who had experienced at least 1 war-related stressor (combat, torture, internal displacement, refugee experience, siege, and/or aerial bombardment) from 4 sites in former Yugoslavia, accessed through linkage sampling. Control groups at 2 study sites were matched with survivors on sex, age, and education. Main Outcome Measures Semi-structured Interview for Survivors of War, Redress for Trauma Survivors Questionnaire, Emotions and Beliefs After War questionnaire, Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). Results The mean (SD) age was 39 (12) years, 806 (59\%) were men, and 339 (25\%) had high school or higher level of education. Participants reported experiencing a mean of 12.6 war-related events, with 292 (22\%) and 451 (33\%) having current and lifetime posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), respectively, and 129 (10\%) with current major depression. A total of 1074 (79\%) of the survivors reported a sense of injustice in relation to perceived lack of redress for trauma. Perceived impunity for those held responsible for trauma was only one of the factors associated with sense of injustice. Relative to controls, survivors had stronger emotional responses to impunity, greater fear and loss of control over life, less belief in benevolence of people, greater loss of meaning in war cause, stronger faith in God, and higher rates of PTSD and depression. Fear and loss of control over life were associated with PTSD and depression (odds ratio [OR], 2.91; 95\% CI, 2.27-3.74 and OR, 2.30; 95\% CI, 1.75-3.03, respectively), and emotional responses to impunity showed a relatively weaker association with PTSD (OR, 1.53; 95\% CI, 1.16-2.02) and depression (OR, 1.39; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.91). Appraisal of redress for trauma was not associated with PTSD or depression. Conclusions PTSD and depression in war survivors appear to be independent of sense of injustice arising from perceived lack of redress for trauma. Fear of threat to safety and loss of control over life appeared to be the most important mediating factors in PTSD and depression. These findings may have important implications for reconciliation efforts in postwar countries and effective interventions for traumatized war survivors.},

  abstract = {The article contends that an important but overlooked explanation for the European Union's resilience in the past decade in the face of several existential crises has been the informal instrumental leadership roles played by EU institutional actors collaborating with each other. In this article, a theoretical framework is developed that can explain why EU governments, facing a crisis, would choose to informally delegate leadership tasks to a set of EU institutional actors. A three-part mechanism of collaborative instrumental leadership provided by institutions is devised that explains why governments informally delegate leadership tasks to EU institutions, and the effects of this informal delegation. The core of the article is a process-tracing case study that explores how collaborative instrumental leadership actually works. The case selected is the British renegotiation of their terms of membership in 2015\textendash 2016. While the case has become more-or-less forgotten because the shock `no' vote in the June 2016 Brexit referendum made its terms moot, the deal included quite exceptional reform proposals in which the EU bent over backwards to accommodate the United Kingdom, perhaps even going beyond the bounds of the EU Treaties themselves in the issue of immigration. Given this, analysing how collaborative instrumental leadership supplied by institutions contributed to producing the ambitious deal can shed light on the processes whereby intractable problems in the EU have been solved in the past decade.},

Whether statements can be so depends on the potential availability of the relevant evidence (e.g., no evidence exists that can prove or disprove the existence of God, but good quality evidence is potentially available in many other cases). The Bayes formula can be used to measure the extent to which a given set of empirical observations supports or weakens the belief that a causal mechanism exists. With this approach, confidence in the existence of a mechanism is increased or decreased through a process that can be open, transparent, and shared with the public or groups of stakeholders, reducing cognitive biases, and improving internal validity and consensus around the existence of given mechanisms. The approach is showcased in the evaluation of a learning partnership whereby a knowledge product released by a research organization influenced policy at the municipal level.},

(Bene 2013:7)"large majority of the approaches proposed often limit their analyses at one unique level of resilience \textendash{} usually the household level (see e.g. Ciani and Romano 2013; Kurtz and Langworthy 2013)." (Bene 2013:8)"Box 2 A good example of an independent measure of resilience" (Bene 2013:9)"resilience results from the synergy and trade-offs between three core attributes: the absorptive, the adaptive and the transformative capacities of households (or system) under consideration" (Bene 2013:10)"When the absorptive capacity is exceeded, however, the individual will then exercise their adaptive resilience." (Bene 2013:10)"Every type of responses and their outcomes (persistence, incremental adjustment or radical transformation) have different transactional costs" (Bene 2013:10)"The key point here is to recognise that anticipating, absorbing, accommodating, and recovering from the effects of a hazardous event induces some costs." (Bene 2013:11)"more resilient household (or community, or system) is one that makes less `sacrifices' (i.e. that pay lower resilience costs*) to pass through a given shock, than a less resilient household (or community, or system)" (Bene 2013:11)massive question-begging - how do you know that investing in resilience might not be to your advantage in the medium term and even save you money/pain?

(Bene 2013:11)"as the rest of this paper will make clear, resilience is not simply about economics or financial costs, it is also about social, psychological, or ecological `costs'.

\par
"The lower the resilience costs*, the more resilient the system is (to a given shock)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_M7U5JQND/12}{Bene 2013:12})
\par
"Recently Venton and her colleagues (2012) also proposed to measure the 'costs of resilience'. Their objective however was not to establish a way to quantify resilience, but to get a sense of how much it costs (to donors) to build resilience and whether resilience interventions are more cost-effective than conventional humanitarian interventions." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_M7U5JQND/12}{Bene 2013:12})
\par
"Whether or not these interventions did actually increase the targeted communities' resilience is not discussed in their analysis." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_M7U5JQND/12}{Bene 2013:12})
\par
"Measuring resilience by estimating the costs* it takes to go through a shock is not new in itself. A few years ago, Michael Carter and his colleagues had adopted a similar approach. In their 2007 paper these authors explore the way households in Honduras and in Ethiopia responded to two distinct disasters: Hurricane Mitch in Honduras in 1998 and the 1998-2000 drought in Ethiopia. Carter and his colleagues were not interested in resilience per se (although they mention the term in passing in several places in the paper); they were interested in determining whether a disaster can be so detrimental that it 'pushes down' households below a critical asset level under which these households are not able to recover (what they call the 'poverty trap' threshold). In Carter's words:  '...what are the longer-term effects of shocks on households and their livelihoods? Are households able to quickly re-establish their livelihoods and the assets needed to support them, or is recovery a slow, drawn-out process, especially for poorer households who may be less able to leverage the resources needed to rebuild? Indeed, is there a "poverty trap" from which households can rarely recover...'  (Carter et al. 2007: 836)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_M7U5JQND/12}{Bene 2013:12})
\par
\emph{and the implicit coefficients of 1 for each of these costs also begs a question (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_M7U5JQND/12}{note on p.12})}
\par
"In other words, the poor have very little to lose (which explains why the richer in these communities are likely to lose more - in absolute terms), but that 'very little' is actually a larger share of the poor's initial assets. On Fig. 2 this translates by the fact that |A| {$>$} |B| but A/A* {$<$} B/B*." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_M7U5JQND/13}{Bene 2013:13})
\par
"the poorer are slower at rebuilding their asset-base than the richer," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_M7U5JQND/13}{Bene 2013:13})
\par
"resilience is not simply about change (loss) in assets, it is also about individual's psychological stress following a disaster" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_M7U5JQND/14}{Bene 2013:14})

"Measuring resilience by estimating the costs* it takes to go through a shock is not new in  itself. A few years ago, Michael Carter and his colleagues had adopted a similar approach. In  their 2007 paper these authors explore the way households in Honduras and in Ethiopia  responded to two distinct disasters: Hurricane Mitch in Honduras in 1998 and the 1998-2000  drought in Ethiopia. Carter and his colleagues were not interested in resilience per se  (although they mention the term in passing in several places in the paper); they were  interested in determining whether a disaster can be so detrimental that it `pushes down'  households below a critical asset level under which these households are not able to recover  (what they call the `poverty trap' threshold). In Carter's words:    `...what are the longer-term effects of shocks on households and their livelihoods? Are  households able to quickly re-establish their livelihoods and the assets needed to  support them, or is recovery a slow, drawn-out process, especially for poorer  households who may be less able to leverage the resources needed to rebuild?  Indeed, is there a ``poverty trap'' from which households can rarely recover...'  (Carter  et al. 2007: 836)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_M7U5JQND/12}{Bene 2013:12})

"In other words, the poor have  very little to lose (which explains why the richer in these communities are likely to lose more  \textendash{} in absolute terms), but that `very little' is actually a larger share of the poor's initial assets.  On Fig. 2 this translates by the fact that |A| {$>$} |B| but A/A* {$<$} B/B*." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_M7U5JQND/13}{Bene 2013:13})

Access to operator data is a prerequisite for the future use of the method. The study demonstrates however that for the purpose of predicting future outbreaks, mobile phone operators may not need to provide access to their complete customer databases, but rather only to aggregated data on mobility between areas. Such aggregated connectivity matrices can be made available for preparedness purposes before outbreaks. They can then be repeatedly updated during the outbreak response to take into account changes in population mobility, which would not be captured by a gravity model.}

It argues for the need to clearly distinguish between this approach and that of levels of evidence, which is linked to data collection and processing methods (e.g. single case observations, difference methods, randomized controlled trials\textbackslash ldots).

  abstract = {Originally created in 2000 by Conservation International (CI), the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the World Bank, the Partnership Fund for eco- critical systems (CEPF) is distinguished by its support organizations of international civil society, regional and local authorities in the implementation of actions and conservation projects in areas where biodiversity is particularly rich and threatened (hotspots bio- Diversity). during replenishment in 2007, 2008-2012 (CEPF2), France, via the French Development Agency (AFD) has become a partner and new lessor CEPF. His contribution Financial amounted to 19.5 million (M) Euro (EUR) equivalent to the initial contributions of other par- financial partners. In addition, France, via the Department of Foreign Affairs (MFA) has funded from 2010, the provision of a technical assistant to the Fund Secretariat in Washington. This assessment of the French contribution to the CEPF comes as the implementation of the second frame CEPF 2008-2012 strategic intervention arrived due. This strategic assessment for France, but also for the other partners, is therefore in a pivotal time for CEPF, including the new strategic framework for 2013-2017 is in response finalized, and is targeting a rise of funds over the next few years, thanks to the integration of nou- calves donors, to multiply its interventions. This exercise provides an overall assessment of the relevance, value added synergies, feedback effects and the influence of the contribution of SFM to the Fund, the 2008-2012. The evaluation methodology was developed so answer all the questions raised in the Terms of Reference (TOR), according to five levels of evaluation which were conducted in parallel through different tools data collection, namely: \textbullet{} relevance and consistency of the AFD commitment; \textbullet{} added value of CEPF; \textbullet{} synergy and complementarity with the tools CEPF  bilateral in the French priority areas; \textbullet{} feedback effects; \textbullet{} influence. September evaluation questions were defined to meet the different expectations expressed in the TDR and the members of the reference group of the evaluation. The judgment ment of the relevance, coherence and performance do not refer in this evaluation exercise, exclusively tively to the priorities of the instrument being valued (CEPF), but primarily to the specific needs of the AFD and France vis-\`a-vis this contribution. The evaluation process involved in the implementation of five steps: 1. establishing the framework for the evaluation; 2. critical synthesis of performance evaluations CEPF: Detailed analysis of past assessments CEPF performance; 3. Implementation of the evaluation process: collection and synthesis of information through a review detailed literature; interviews in France (AFD, MAE, non-governmental organizations [NGOs] French) at Washington (CEPF Secretariat, GEF, World Bank, CI) with regional implementation teams, Regional Implementation Team (RIT), regional and local NGOs receiving support CEPF project partners implemented (local authorities, beneficiaries); visits four selected hotspots (Guinean forests of Africa Western [Sierra Leone and Liberia], Madagascar, Caribbean [Dominican Republic and Haiti] and the Indo-Burma hotspot [Cambodia] and further analysis on hotspots Mediterranean, Polynesia / Micronesia, Cape Town area Flora, Coastal Forests of Eastern Africa New Caledonia (excluding CEPF); 4. Summary and conclusions; proposed recommendations tions for discussion at the fourth meeting of the group Reference of the evaluation; 5. synthesis, release, and restitution. The evaluation exercise has helped bring some number of observations, from which the team could Baastel formulate conclusions for each level evalu- assess- and each of the evaluation questions defined at this exercise. These findings and conclusions are summarized infra. \#\# Relevance and coherence of AFD's commitment The approach and CEPF intervention priorities are with the relevant priorities for biodiversity, use of innovative financing and partially with geographic priorities of France and AFD. Although improvements and corrections are always possible, one can indeed say that the CEPF involved the achievement of the objectives of France's bio- versity, as well as innovative financing. The CEPF priorities and objectives are generally well aligned with those of the French public aid to development. This is also true in terms of geographical priorities graphic, thanks to recent developments in the CEPF in the Francophone world, although its mandate calls work well beyond the French priority areas and if hotspot by its intervention strategy excludes large areas of the Francophone (Sahelian and Basin Congo in particular). Funded interventions are generally CEPF relevant to local development issues, which are increasingly integrated from the realization of profiles ecosystems. However, improvements are desirable tables to better meet these challenges, in particular to to increase the level of involvement of local actors (NGOs local, but also universities and private sector) compared international actors, which remain the main ben- beneficiaries of grants. **Added value CEPF** Compared to the corpus of programs and funds Multi benefit of conservation on the one hand, and compared to the direct intervention of the other AFD, CEPF, so the French contribution to the CEPF bring a real and recognized value. CEPF has a unique place in this landscape, and became an actor major biodiversity funding, appreciated for its operation and its strong orientation biodiversity on scientific grounds. In terms of relevance, referred targets CEPF are different and complementary to those of in- instru- classic AFD. Moreover, interventions CEPF provide specific added value in the landscape of programs and funds working in multi the field of conservation. In terms of results, it is undeniable that CEPF gets actual results (outputs and outcomes) compliant to the objectives set for it, although more results in terms of strengthening the capacity of NGOs local and improvement of living conditions are often haitables.  However, the monitoring and evaluation device these results, particularly in terms of development capacity and socioeconomic development, greatly benefit from further systematized. In terms of efficiency, supported by CEPF operations are organized and implemented in a relatively satisfactory (implementation time, management costs) and especially when compared to those supported by other global funds such as the GEF. In terms of governance, the system set up by CEPF is clear, transparent and efficient, and above all, has evolved positively in recent years, either regarding the role of ICs in the system, or placing up RIT. Adjustments are still to do so to take into account the experience feedback, but the satisfaction of grant recipients is generally high. In terms of impacts, some examples identified by the evaluation team during field missions four hotspots shows that interventions CEPF have impacts in terms of biodiversity, improving living conditions and strengthening synergies between conservation actions and those of development. However, it is important that the LCL has a tem monitoring tem with a participatory component, allowing measure obtaining long-term impacts through funding allocated. In terms of involvement of local civil society and sustainability, it was found that the activities of NGOs often held by the CEPF are generally caused to Per- follow over the long term. CEPF also widely promoted the development of stronger interrelationships the key players in the field of conservation and networking. Finally, in terms of the contribution of science and re- seeks evaluation team concluded that the approach and science contributed to a decision lit under the prioritization of actions eligible CEPF and influenced public regional strategies and national, for all categories of actors. Synergies and complementarities with CEPF tools bilateral in the French priority areas The CEPF instrument and interventions have synergies and are in complementary, not duplication of interventions such projects / programs AFD and France. CEPF is also complementary tional funds or other instruments supported by the France, including the GEF, which occurs through the govern- ments and in a more institutional way and diffuse the CEPF. CEPF is a unique tool, predominant in the field of biodiversity, which proposes an approach specific complementary to other instruments and funds proposed or supported by France, namely ease sectoral innovation for NGOs (FISONG), the Fund French Global Environment Facility (GEF) and Pro- gram of small initiatives (PPI) FFEM projects AFD one hand, and the GEF other. It supports significant and targeted, worldwide, organizations civil society on the basis of specific criteria (Hotspots, ecosystem profiles), and so offers global response to the loss of biodiversity on the planet. Examples of synergies between these international tools tion can be addressed at the project level, but their integration into a more global scale is very low. Feedback effects The analysis conducted thus demonstrates that the benefits to AFD and France, are participating in CEPF low, particularly in terms of local visibility, strengthening cement partnerships with international NGOs conservation and experience capitalization. The visibility and influence of the AFD and France in the conservation area have been improved in International but still very limited and dependent local agencies. CEPF has not really helped strengthening partnerships AFD with major international conservation NGOs, although the positioning of the agency in the field conservation through CEPF will facilitate alliances and joint projects in the future. The team evaluation also noted that the AFD commitment the CEPF has little to mobilize the French and Francophone civil society in this program or strengthening positioning expertise French in the field of conservation. However, recent developments (with the expansion of space French- cophone covered by CEPF mainly), if supported by the AFD, may allow development interesting in the future. This improvement can legitimately be placed on the account of the influence of the AFD and the MAE (Through its Technical Assistant) on the CEPF made his contribution. Finally, the capitalization of experience within AFD and major French NGOs involved (Learning effect) was very limited. Similarly, the fact that France contributes to the CEPF is still very little known in France, even in the AFD agencies.  \#\#\# Influence The influence of France (French actors in society civil, AFD and MAE, particularly through its technical assistant nique) in Strategic Directions CEPF was real. This concerns the geographical coverage of CEPF (Choice of intervention areas) and the emphasis is on increasingly given to the developmental aspects funded programs. However, at the field level, teams AFD network and the French players Civil society does not have a significant influence on the directions taken, especially in the eco- profiles tems and prioritization of intervention areas within hotspots (choice of key areas of biodiversity priorities tions) and projects implemented with funding CEPF, due to their very low mobilization. Additional to act at the global level (board of donors in particular) AFD could think of ways to play a greater role decisive at the hotspots themselves, eg promoting synergies and joint projects between AFD and CEPF, mobilizing actors in French hotspots around the CEPF, and actively contributing to the definition of intervention areas within hotspots at the formulation of ecosystem profiles.  \#\# Recommendations The contribution of France to the CEPF has therefore not allowed synergies and feedback effects initially expected. Certain expectations, such as those relating to visibility or the capitalization of experiences, may have missed realism, at least in the context of the AFD period, ie a low dynamic on these issues biodiversity from the direction of the AFD, and significant strain on the available working time of human resources at headquarters and in branch. It is therefore for AFD, as part of the reflection on the renewal LEMENT of his contribution, **to question the objectives this contribution**, and the best ways to par- come.  Based on the findings of this assessment and interim recommendations were discussed with the reference group, three scenarios or levels Wait, are proposed gradual and cumulative, each involving specific recommendations, all necessary for the successful completion of these scenarios, which are detailed in the body of the report. These three levels are: 1 / the contribution of SFM to CEPF aims to promote the conservation of biodiversity importance World. In this scenario, based on the results obtained by CEPF over the past twelve years, France, as part of its new contribution, why would limit its recommendations to the CEPF few elements performance improvement ments of the fund and monitoring results;  2 / the contribution of SFM to CEPF aims to increase the influence of France on how bio- diversity of global importance is managed and preserved. In this scenario, the highlighting of thematic priorities and French geographical priority is placed and constituted kill one of the key recommendations of France CEPF when renewing his contribution;  3 / complement the objectives mentioned in points 1 and 2, the contribution of France to the CEPF aims to feed the AFD operations, through research strong **synergies** with AFD and French GEF projects, the capitalization tion of experience and a real impact on the players French biodiversity, including NGOs, as well as terms of visibility. In this scenario, France and AFD particular, would work to maximize the value of its invest- invest- in the LCL in order to not only obtain results in line with expectations of the Agency, but EGALEMENT to derive significant benefit through synergies developed the tools adopted and capitalized experiences, and the strong involvement of all relevant actors French.},

In particular, theories that do a decent job explaining cases of causal preemption have problems accounting for cases of causal intransitivity. Moreover, the increasing complexity of the counterfactual accounts makes it difficult to see why the concept of causation would be such a central part of our cognition. In this paper, I propose an account of our causal thinking that not only explains the hitherto puzzling variety of causal judgments, but also makes it intelligible why we would employ such an elusive concept.},

In this article we share our evolving views on the points of connection and digression between the approaches based on our reading of the theory-based evaluation literature and our practice experience. We provide a background to the two approaches that emphasizes the importance of programme context in understanding how complex programmes lead to changes in outcomes.We then explore some of the differences in how `theory' is conceptualized and used within the two approaches and consider how knowledge is generated and cumulated in subtly different ways depending on the approach that is taken. Finally, we offer our thoughts on what this means for evaluators on the ground seeking an appropriate framework for their practice.},

  abstract = {Throughout history, humans have frequently carried out harmful actions against one another. Often, these actions result in intensive and long lasting pain and suffering. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis has been the theoretical tool used mostly by psychologists to understand the physical, emotional and behavioural symptoms following a traumatic experience. Due to its clinical and medical roots, PTSD diagnosis represents man in a social vacuum, a man without context, and a model of health closely tied to illness. The aim of the paper is to reintroduce the social context of human beings into trauma diagnosis, and to develop a health model that is more focused on well-being than on illness. Both points of mew help us to seek a theoretical way for better understanding the psychosocial trauma that result from political violence and terrorism. Psychosocial trauma has definite roots, and destroys our inner world--the world of our most valuable meanings--infects our minds with hate against others, and breaks the social fabric we belong to.

  abstract = {Applied agricultural research institutes play different roles in complex agricultural innovation processes, contributing to them with other actors. To foster learning and usable knowledge on how research actions influence such lasting innovation processes, there is a need to identify the causal mechanisms linking these actions and the effects of the changes they enable. A participatory, theory-driven, ex-post evaluation method, ImpresS, was developed by the French Agricultural Research Center for International Development (Cirad). ImpresS reconstructs the innovation history and its impact pathway by analyzing behavioral mechanisms linked to stakeholders' individual reactions and responses, and underlying process mechanisms at a group level. ImpresS relies on iterative updating and refinement and on triangulating data sources and collection methods to ensure internal validity and to increase credibility by enabling different actors to express their viewpoints. Drawing on an in-depth case study, we discuss how ImpresS makes it possible to draw robust conclusions on causal mechanisms while posing challenges linked to the group dynamics and power imbalances commonly encountered in participatory methods. As demonstrated by the case study, ImpresS generates policy-relevant knowledge for future research projects. It also demonstrates how research actions can help coconstruct lasting dynamics that can survive fluctuating institutional support. Distinguishing between behavioral and process mechanisms benefits knowledge use as it makes it possible to disentangle the conditions that trigger changes in a given context while generating research questions concerning the external validity of mechanism hypotheses.},

  abstract = {Causality was at the center of the early history of Structural Equation Models (SEMs) which continue to serve as the most popular approach to causal analysis in the social sciences. Through decades of development critics and defenses of the capability of SEMs to support causal inference have accumulated. A variety of misunderstandings and myths about the nature of SEMs and their role in causal analysis have emerged and their repetition has led some to believe they are true. Our paper is organized by presenting eight myths about causality and SEMs in the hope that this will lead to a more accurate understanding. More specifically, the eight myths are: (1) SEMs aim to establish causal relations from associations alone, (2) SEMs and regression are essentially equivalent, (3) No causation without manipulation, (4) SEMs are not equipped to handle nonlinear causal relationships, (5) A potential outcome framework is more principled than SEMs, (6) SEMs are not applicable to experiments with randomized treatments, (7) Mediation analysis in SEMs is inherently noncausal, and (8) SEMs do not test any major part of the theory against the data. We present the facts that dispell these myths, describe what SEMs can and cannot do, and briefly present our critique of current practice using SEMs. We conclude that the current capabilities of SEMs to formalize and implement causal inference tasks are indispensible; its potential to do more is even greater.},

Many people are exposed to loss or potentially traumatic events at some point in their lives, and yet they continue to have positive emotional experiences and show only minor and transient disruptions in their ability to function. Unfortunately, because much of psychology's knowledge about how adults cope with loss or trauma has come from individuals who sought treatment or exhibited great distress, loss and trauma theorists have often viewed this type of resilience as either rare or pathological. The author challenges these assumptions by reviewing evidence that resilience represents a distinct trajectory from the process of recovery, that resilience in the face of loss or potential trauma is more common than is often believed, and that there are multiple and sometimes unexpected pathways to resilience.

  abstract = {Recent studies have emphasized the merits of search processes that lack overarching objectives, instead promoting divergence by rewarding behavioral novelty. While this less objective search paradigm is more open-ended and divergent, it still differs significantly from nature's mechanism of divergence. Rather than measuring novelty explicitly, nature is guided by a single, fundamental constraint: survive long enough to reproduce. Surprisingly, this simple constraint produces both complexity and diversity in a continual process unparalleled by any algorithm to date. Inspired by the relative simplicity of open-endedness in nature in comparison to recent non-objective algorithms, this paper investigates the extent to which interactions between two coevolving populations, both subject to their own constraint, or minimal criterion, can produce results that are both functional and diverse even without any behavior characterization or novelty archive. To test this new approach, a novel maze navigation domain is introduced wherein evolved agents must learn to navigate mazes whose structures are simultaneously coevolving and increasing in complexity. The result is a broad range of maze topologies and successful agent trajectories in a single run, thereby suggesting the viability of minimal criterion coevolution as a new approach to non-objective search and a step towards genuinely open-ended algorithms.},

Parents see the principal as the most important link for parent participation. Roma are completely excluded from school life. Only one out of 16 Roma parents from the two focus groups had ever heard of a parents council. Their greatest problem remains the unjust attitude towards their children and poor relations with parents of non-Roma children. Parents of children with special needs are comparatively more involved in school life due to the lack of professional staff at schools. Parents rarely mention positive examples of participation.},

Samples are usually larger than typical for qualitative studies: ranging from a lower end of 20-49 (e.g., Barrett, 2007; Clarke \& Smith, 2015; Clarke \& Spence, 2013; Grogan \& Mechan, 2017; Grogan et al., 2018; Hayfield, 2013) to a mid-range of 60-99 (e.g., Braun et al., 2013; Clarke, 2016, 2019; Frith \& Gleeson, 2004, 2008; Peel, 2010) and an upper end of well over one hundred" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XNU5ZAFU?page=10}{Braun et al 2020:10})

"people with alopecia (Davey, 2019). The more structured data generated by qualitative surveys compared to - say - interviews can seduce researchers into summarizing the responses to each question and dubbing these 'themes'. We urge users of qualitative surveys to resist any temptation to summarize responses to each question, as this typically results in an impoverished and underdeveloped qualitative analysis. We have found it most productive to treat, and work with, the data as one cohesive dataset, coding, and developing analytic patterns across the entire dataset.

  abstract = {The concept of data saturation, defined as `information redundancy' or the point at which no new themes or codes `emerge' from data, is widely referenced in thematic analysis (TA) research in sport and exercise, and beyond. Several researchers have sought to `operationalise' data saturation and provide concrete guidance on how many interviews, or focus groups, are enough to achieve some degree of data saturation in TA research. Our disagreement with such attempts to `capture' data saturation for TA led us to this commentary. Here, we contribute to critical discussions of the saturation concept in qualitative research by interrogating the assumptions around the practice and procedures of TA that inform these data saturation `experiments', and the conceptualisation of saturation as information redundancy. We argue that although the concepts of data-, thematic- or code-saturation, and even meaning-saturation, are coherent with the neo-positivist, discovery-oriented, meaning excavation project of coding reliability types of TA, they are not consistent with the values and assumptions of reflexive TA. We encourage sport and exercise and other researchers using reflexive TA to dwell with uncertainty and recognise that meaning is generated through interpretation of, not excavated from, data, and therefore judgements about `how many' data items, and when to stop data collection, are inescapably situated and subjective, and cannot be determined (wholly) in advance of analysis.},

The impact of the clinical significance criterion on the lifetime prevalence of PTSD among civilian victims of traumatic events has not been evaluated. Method: Data from two community-based samples were examined, the 1996 Detroit Area Survey of Trauma (n = 2181) and the Mid-Atlantic Urban Youth Study (n = 1698). The World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WHO CIDI) was used to ascertain DSM-IV PTSD. Results: The inclusion of the clinical significance criterion in DSM-IV reduces the conditional probability of PTSD given exposure to trauma by approximately 30\%. Cases with clinically significant syndrome showed more pervasive and persistent disturbance and an excess in impaired activity days. Conclusions: The consistency of the findings between the two studies strengthens the evidence on the impact of the clinical significance criterion in the diagnosis of PTSD, and the construct validity of its measurement. There is a need for greater research effort on the definition and measurement of the clinical significance criterion. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2008 APA, all rights reserved)}

Female victims of traumatic events are at higher risk for PTSD than male victims are. Direct evidence on the causes of the sex difference in the conditional risk of PTSD is unavailable. The available evidence suggests that the sex difference is not due to (a) the higher occurrence of sexual assault among females, (b) prior traumatic experiences, (c) preexisting depression or anxiety disorder, or (d) sex-related bias in reporting. Observed sex differences in anxiety, neuroticism, and depression, inducing effects of stressful experiences, might provide a theoretical context for further inquiry into the greater vulnerability of females to PTSD.}

  title = {Mapping Methods for Qualitative Data Structuring ({{QDS}})},
  author = {Brightman, Jenny},
  year = {2003},
  pages = {1--14},
  abstract = {Introduction The purpose of this paper is to outline and discuss the characteristics and use of four different methods for " mapping " qualitative data. The methods discussed are mind mapping (developed primarily by Tony Buzan. Buzan with Buzan 1993)), concept mapping (developed primarily by Joseph Novak. Novak \& Gowan 1984), cognitive mapping (developed primarily by Colin Eden -with David Sims and Sue Jones and later with Fran Ackermann. Eden, Jones, \& Sims 1979, Ackermann et al 1992, Eden \& Ackermann 1998) and dialog mapping (developed by Jeff Conklin. Conklin 2003). Each of these methods provides a framework for structuring qualitative data (ideas). While there are some similarities between the four methods each has its own distinctive characteristics. These characteristics are described in detail, with a short illustration and sample map. The characteristics are then summarized and contrasted at the end of the paper. Any one of these methods might be of interest and of use to individuals and groups of researchers who either need to structure their own thinking about a project or who wish to use one of the methods to gain new insights into their research data. Which method you use to map your data depends on what you are trying to achieve. Qualitative data analysis (QDA) context Qualitative data analysis texts and journals (see note 1) show a focus on the " code and retrieve " approach for structuring and analyzing qualitative data. These methods tend to form the main body of work in studies using qualitative data. A "typical" QDA project might involve a series of interviews or focus groups from which information is recorded and transcribed and then "coded" into various categories. The researcher's own notes, recorded as linear text, may also be added to the repository of data and coded using a particular coding approach (such as open coding, axial coding or selective coding). Conclusions are then drawn from and theories built around the coded data. Mapping the structure of ideas, be they the researcher's ideas about a project or the research subjects' ideas is generally a small part of such QDA studies. In talking about causal mapping Miles and Hubermann observe that: " the conventional view is that qualitative studies are only good for exploratory forays, for developing hypotheses -and that strong explanations, including causal attribution, can be derived only through quantitative studies " (Miles \& Hubermann. 1994). The result of this view is that researchers do not appear to explore the use of mapping methods (particularly causal ones), either for their own use or as part of their study. There are, however, several well-established ideas mapping methods for qualitative data structuring (QDS) -not all of which are causal methods. These methods offer different frameworks for organizing ideas and providing insight into qualitative data. As well as being of use to the researcher in organizing his/ her own thinking, ideas mapping can be used to express and explore the relationship between the different variables in the data, to explore the causal and other relationships expressed in the data, and highlight actions and their consequences. The four QDS methods discussed here developed in different fields of study. The mind mapping technique was developed and popularized primarily by Tony Buzan, in the UK, who started his career at the Daily Telegraph Newspaper, in London. As an undergraduate at the University of British Columbia, studying psychology, English, mathematics and general science he became absorbed by questions which related to how we learn, the nature of thinking and the best techniques for creative thinking. This led to further studying of " psychology, the neuro-pathology of the brain, semantics, neuro-linguistics, information theory, memory and mnemonic techniques, perception, creative thinking and the general sciences " . (Buzan with Buzan 1993). In 1971 he started to write about his ideas on mind mapping and radiant thinking, " Use your head " was published in 1974.},

However, place attachments have been neglected as a potential strength in declining suburban neighborhoods. Hierarchical linear modeling analyses are used to examine attachment to the home and attachment to the block/neighborhood for over 600 residents of a neighborhood with a history of gradual decline. Results show that overall place attachment is higher for home owners, long-term residents, and non-Whites or Hispanics. Place attachment is also high for individuals who perceive fewer incivilities on their block, who have fewer observed incivilities on their property, who have lower fear of crime, and who have a higher sense of neighborhood cohesion and control (i.e. collective efficacy). Furthermore, blocks with more home owners, non-Whites or Hispanics, perceived and observed incivilities, and lower fear of crime have residents with higher overall place attachments. Differences between predictors of home and block/neighborhood attachment are discussed and place attachment is proposed as an underutilized tool for neighborhood revitalization.},

  abstract = {One aim of development volunteer services is to foster positive attitudes in participants toward those they encounter in their host countries. However, the psychological mechanisms underlying such attitude change remain underexplored. This is true despite intergroup contact theory proposing that contact between groups causes more positive intergroup attitudes through the mechanism of increased mutual knowledge, improved perspective-taking, and higher levels of empathy. A theory-based multi-method evaluation of the German weltw\"arts development volunteer service included a quasi-experimental component to address the question of whether and how development volunteering contributes to such attitude change. Part of this component was the specification of a multiple-mediator model based on intergroup contact theory to investigate the mechanism that brings about attitude change at a critical juncture of the program theory. The evaluation observed a highly significant small-to-medium-sized effect of development volunteering on intergroup attitudes ({$\beta$} =.19). The analysis revealed that this effect was fully mediated by changes in the mediational pathways of knowledge, perspective-taking, and empathy. The mediation analysis thereby lent strong support to the validity of causal hypotheses derived from intergroup contact theory in the context of development volunteering. It also substantially increased the explanatory strength, utility, and policy relevance of the evaluation. Based on these evaluation findings, development volunteer services should be designed such that they allow for the identified mechanism to fully unfold in order to increase program effectiveness. The chapter ends with a discussion of limitations and future directions concerning the use of mediation analysis in program evaluation.},

But creating a model requires far more than just raw data and technical skills: it requires a close collaboration between model commissioners, developers, users and reviewers. Good modelling requires its users and commissioners to understand more about the whole process, including the different kinds of purpose a model can have and the different technical bases. This paper offers a guide to the process of commissioning, developing and deploying models across a wide range of domains from public policy to science and engineering. It provides two checklists to help potential modellers, commissioners and users ensure they have considered the most significant factors that will determine success. We conclude there is a need to reinforce modelling as a discipline, so that misconstruction is less likely; to increase understanding of modelling in all domains, so that the misuse of models is reduced; and to bring commissioners closer to modelling, so that the results are more useful.},

  abstract = {What kinds of evidence reliably support predictions of effectiveness for health and social care interventions? There is increasing reliance, not only for health care policy and practice but also for more general social and economic policy deliberation, on evidence that comes from studies whose basic logic is that of JS Mill's method of difference. These include randomized controlled trials, case-control studies, cohort studies, and some uses of causal Bayes nets and counterfactual-licensing models like ones commonly developed in econometrics. The topic of this paper is the 'external validity' of causal conclusions from these kinds of studies. We shall argue two claims. Claim, negative: external validity is the wrong idea; claim, positive: 'capacities' are almost always the right idea, if there is a right idea to be had. If we are right about these claims, it makes big problems for policy decisions. Many advice guides for grading policy predictions give top grades to a proposed policy if it has two good Mill's-method-of difference studies that support it. But if capacities are to serve as the conduit for support from a method-of-difference study to an effectiveness prediction, much more evidence, and much different in kind, is required. We will illustrate the complexities involved with the case of multisystemic therapy, an internationally adopted intervention to try to diminish antisocial behaviour in young people.},

  abstract = {Background Falls in the elderly are a major public health concern because of their high incidence, the involvement of many risk factors, the considerable post-fall morbidity and mortality, and the health-related and social costs. Given that many falls are preventable, the early identification of older adults at risk of falling is crucial in order to develop tailored interventions to prevent such falls. To date, however, the fall-risk assessment tools currently used in the elderly have not shown sufficiently high predictive validity to distinguish between subjects at high and low fall risk. Consequently, predicting the risk of falling remains an unsolved issue in geriatric medicine. This one-year prospective study aims to develop and validate, by means of a cross-validation method, a multifactorial fall-risk model based on clinical and robotic parameters in older adults. Methods Community-dwelling subjects aged {$\geq$} 65 years were enrolled. At the baseline, all subjects were evaluated for history of falling and number of drugs taken daily, and their gait and balance were evaluated by means of the Timed ``Up \& Go'' test (TUG), Gait Speed (GS), Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA). They also underwent robotic assessment by means of the hunova robotic device to evaluate the various components of balance. All subjects were followed up for one-year and the number of falls was recorded. The models that best predicted falls\textemdash on the basis of: i) only clinical parameters; ii) only robotic parameters; iii) clinical plus robotic parameters\textemdash were identified by means of a cross-validation method. Results Of the 100 subjects initially enrolled, 96 (62 females, mean age 77.17{$\pm$}.49 years) completed the follow-up and were included. Within one year, 32 participants (33\%) experienced at least one fall (``fallers''), while 64 (67\%) did not (``non-fallers''). The best classifier model to emerge from cross-validated fall-risk estimation included eight clinical variables (age, sex, history of falling in the previous 12 months, TUG, Tinetti, SPPB, Low GS, number of drugs) and 20 robotic parameters, and displayed an area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.81 (95\% CI: 0.72\textendash 0.90). Notably, the model that included only three of these clinical variables (age, history of falls and low GS) plus the robotic parameters showed similar accuracy (ROC AUC 0.80, 95\% CI: 0.71\textendash 0.89). In comparison with the best classifier model that comprised only clinical parameters (ROC AUC: 0.67; 95\% CI: 0.55\textendash 0.79), both models performed better in predicting fall risk, with an estimated Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI) of 0.30 and 0.31 (p = 0.02), respectively, and an estimated Integrated Discrimination Improvement (IDI) of 0.32 and 0.27 (p\textbackslash textless0.001), respectively. The best model that comprised only robotic parameters (the 20 parameters identified in the final model) achieved a better performance than the clinical parameters alone, but worse than the combination of both clinical and robotic variables (ROC AUC: 0.73, 95\% CI 0.63\textendash 0.83). Conclusion A multifactorial fall-risk assessment that includes clinical and hunova robotic variables significantly improves the accuracy of predicting the risk of falling in community-dwelling older people. Our data suggest that combining clinical and robotic assessments can more accurately identify older people at high risk of falls, thereby enabling personalized fall-prevention interventions to be undertaken.},

  abstract = {Analytical techniques are generally inadequate for dealing with causal interrelationships among a set of individual and social concepts. Usually, causal maps are used to cope with this type of interrelationships. However, the classical view of causal maps is based on an intuitive view with ad hoc rules and no precise semantics of the primitive concepts, nor a sound formal treatment of relations between concepts. In this paper, we solve this problem by proposing a formal model for causal maps with a precise semantics based on relation algebra and the software tool, CM-RELVIEW, in which it has been implemented. Then, we investigate the issue of using this tool in multiagent environments by explaining through different examples how and why this tool is useful for the following aspects: 1) the reasoning on agents' subjective views, 2) the qualitative distributed decision making, and 3) the organization of agents considered as a holistic approach. For each of these aspects, we focus on the computational mechanisms developed within CM-RELVIEW to support it.},

  abstract = {Logical Framework Analysis (Logframe) and its variants as a required method for planning and monitoring illustrate how procedures can reinforce relationships of power and control. With origins in management practices for infrastructure projects, the logframe embodies a linear logic associated with things rather than people, with simple and controlled conditions, and with closed systems. It has what has been called vertical and horizontal logic, required in a matrix form. The vertical logic down the matrix is concerned with ends and means -with objectives, goals and purposes, then outputs, then the activities intended to achieve the outputs. The horizontal logic across the matrix is from narrative summary to objectively verifiable indicators and means of verification. A final vertical column is used to identify assumptions about the external environment that enable or hinder the realization of activities, outputs and purpose. In many instances, in its time, the logframe has served well to focus attention on the links between activities and their intended effects, and, hence, to sharpen interventions. For example, at the UK Department for International Development (DFID), the logframe was found to be useful in shifting the focus from technology toward people, and in demanding evidence of the connections between proposed activities and their impacts on poverty. This signals that certain procedures have their time and place; but changing conditions may require their reassessment and replacement. In its heyday, the logframe gave rise to a small army of practitioners who trained others in the technique, and then helped them to carry it out. Some agencies have now abandoned it or do not require it -although there are indications that a new generation of policy makers are favouring it as a requirement for funding proposals. Most critics of the logframe recognize the value of thinking through some of the vertical logic of a project, but find the experience of using it costly and disempowering. Donor-induced logframe meetings rarely include poor people, yet participatory poverty assessments present much evidence that the priorities of poor people often differ from those perceived by outsiders and local elites. Often, expatriates dominate and the language is English. The idea in ZOPP (Ziel-Orienterte Projekt Planung), a close relative of the logframe developed by the German aid agency Deutsche Gesellschaft for Technische Zusammenarbeit, is that stakeholders should brainstorm until they agree on one single core problem. This involves a reductionism that flies in the face of multiple and changing realities. Logframe analysis more generally inhibits process and participation and is often experienced as rigid and constraining. When the actual and sensible activities being undertaken differ from those in the frame, reporting can become a nightmare, and the eventual external 'purpose-to-outcome' evaluation can be perceived as a looming threat rather than an opportunity to learn and do better.},

In June 2019, we conducted a cross-sectional survey using mixed methods to investigate how inhabitants of Hanoi perceive and respond to the risk of mosquito-borne diseases (MBD). A total of 117 participants recruited using a stratified random sampling method were interviewed in three districts of Hanoi. Knowledge and practices (KP) regarding MBDs were assessed using a pre-tested questionnaire. Inferential statistics were used to identify factors associated with KP scores and describe the relationship between variables. Additionally, a ``risk-mapping'' exercise was conducted in a subsample through semi-structured interviews and analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively using the System Effects platform. Factors significantly associated with knowledge scores were education and family history of MBDs. While knowledge and practice scores were found to be positively correlated in the statistical analysis, this was not corroborated by our observations on the field. The results also revealed gaps in knowledge about MBDs and vectors and highlighted a general feeling of powerlessness which prevented the adoption of protective behaviors. Therefore, educational interventions which provide concrete tools to empower communities should have a positive impact on improving vector control.},

  abstract = {Nelson-Goff and Smith (2005) and Figley (1989) mandate family therapists to understand the complex interpersonal and psychosocial consequences of war on survivor families of combat stress. One of the most common psychological disturbances suffered by combat soldiers is Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD; Solomon, 1993. This study used unpublished archival data from a study of veterans of the U.S.S. Emmons, which was sunk by kamikaze during World War II for the Battle of Okinawa, and their survivor families (Chara, 2004). The participants were given a background information form and five adapted forms of the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian (PCL-C; Weathers, Litz, Herman, Huska, \& Keane, 1993) regarding the long-term effects of living with a veteran of war. The participants were categorized into two groups: families in which the veteran was on the Emmons when it sunk (Okinawa group) and families in which veterans served on the Emmons before it sunk (Not Okinawa group). There were five main research hypotheses: (a) There would be positive correlations among the veterans' PTSD scores and the PTSD scores (Secondary PTSD) of their family members; (b) the Okinawa group would report higher PTSD scores than those in the Not Okinawa group for the veterans, wives, and adult offspring; (c) wives and adult offspring would report higher PTSD scores when rating the veterans than the veterans' self-reports; (d) there would be mean differences among offspring's Impact Ratings of the veterans, mothers, and siblings, and themselves; and (e) there would be positive correlations among the family members' Impact Ratings, and among Impact Ratings and PCL-C scores. There were three main findings in this study implying an indirect transmission of PTSD among survivor families of veterans of war. These findings are: (a) the offspring reported more severe PTSD symptoms than the veterans, (b) the offspring reported that their mothers were more negatively affected by their father's WW II experiences than the fathers were themselves, and (c) the offspring's perception of his or her father's PTSD symptoms was related to the offspring's self-rated PTSD symptoms and Impact ratings.

We argue that programs (consisting of algorithms and data structures) have a causal (counterfactual-supporting) structure; these counterfactuals can reveal the nature of mental representations. Programs can also provide a causal model of the external world. Such models are, we suggest, ubiquitous in perception, cognition, and language processing.},

We measure survival in two ways: (1) the likelihood the venture will survive for at least 8 years and (2) the overall life span of the venture. The ``Big Five'' personality attributes\textemdash extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience provide the measures of the entrepreneur's personality. As hypothesized, the entrepreneur's conscientiousness was positively related to long-term venture survival. Contrary to expectations, we found a negative relationship between the entrepreneur's openness and long-term venture survival. Extraversion, emotional stability, and agreeableness were unrelated to long-term venture survival.}

  abstract = {Managerial and organizational cognition (MOC) researchers have issued a number of calls over the years for large-scale studies involving the mass application of causal mapping techniques. A number of important advances in the development of procedures for the systematic elicitation and comparison of cause maps mean that such work has been technically feasible for some time. However, due to a dearth of suitable supporting computer software, very few researchers to date have responded to this key challenge, vital to the longer-term viability of the MOC field. Building on innovations by Langfield-Smith and Wirth and Mark\'oczy and Goldberg, the authors report on the development of Cognizer\texttrademark, a comprehensive computer package designed to meet the requirements of researchers looking to elicit and compare large numbers of maps on a longitudinal or cross-sectional basis. The principal features of Cognizer are illustrated using a cross-sectional data set comprising 200 cause maps from five organizations. \textcopyright{} 2005 Sage Publications.},

"Within the Cognizer system, it is possible to elicit such visual representations from participants directly, by having them draw up the diagram on screen. This feature of the program is rather similar to the technique used very successfully in Eden et al.'s (1992) Decision Explorer, although unlike Decision Explorer, Cognizer permits the links incorporated within the map to be formally weighted. Use of this visual mode of elicitation is most useful in the context of the smaller-scale, idiographic applications and intensive interventions more typical of Decision Explorer. It is considerably less useful in the context of larger-scale, hypothetico-deductive work, of the sort exemplified by our illustrative study" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LKR92M75?page=9}{Clarkson and Hodgkinson 2005:325})

  abstract = {Past research on aid and growth is flawed because it typically examines the impact of aggregate aid on growth over a short period, usually four years, while significant portions of aid are unlikely to affect growth in such a brief time. We divide aid into three categories: (1) emergency and humanitarian aid (likely to be negatively correlated with growth); (2) aid that affects growth only over the long term, if at all, such as aid to support democracy, the environment, health, or education (likely to have no relationship to growth over four years); and (3) aid that plausibly could stimulate growth in four years, including budget and balance of payments support, investments in infrastructure, and aid for productive sectors such as agriculture and industry. Our focus is on the third group, which accounts for about 45\% of all aid flows. We find a positive, causal relationship between this short-impact aid and economic growth (with diminishing returns) over a four-year period. The impact is large: at least two-to-three times larger than in studies using aggregate aid. Even at a conservatively high discount rate, at the mean a \$1 increase in short-impact aid raises output (and income) by \$8 in present value in the typical country. From a different perspective, we find that higher-than-average short-impact aid to sub-Saharan Africa raised per capita growth rates there by about one percentage point over the growth that would have been achieved by average aid flows. The results are highly statistically significant and stand up to a demanding array of tests, including various specifications, endogeneity structures, and treatment of influential observations. The basic result does not depend crucially on a recipient's level of income or quality of institutions and policies; we find that short-impact aid causes growth, on average, regardless of these characteristics. However, we find some evidence that the impact on growth is somewhat larger in countries with stronger institutions or longer life expectancies (better health). We also find a significant negative relationship between debt repayments and growth. We make no statement on, and do not attempt to measure, any additional long-run effects of aid; four-year panel regressions are not an appropriate tool to examine those relationships.},

  abstract = {Haiti's earthquake of 12 th January 2010 killed over 220 000 people, injured 300 000, left well over one million homeless, and destroyed infrastructure, services and homes. The cost of reconstruction is estimated at US\$11.5 billion 1 . This happened in a country already the poorest in the western hemisphere, ranked 149 out of 182 countries on the 2009 Human Development Index, with some 78\% of its population living on under US\$2 a day, and beset by huge societal inequality and weak governance. While recognising the effects of the disaster on the whole country, this study is required to focus on the impact within urban areas, and to ask, what can be learnt for international NGOs for the next urban disaster? Several lessons emerge. A first one concerns increased urban risk globally, described by the World Bank in a new report 2 as a 'new game-changer.' If this is right, and urban risk presents something different, then agencies need to learn 'new rules of the game' in urban post disaster response. Issues of complexity, range of actors, space, the importance of commerce and trade, services, infrastructure and sheer concentrations of people require a consideration of how to operate compared to rural contexts, including collaborations (with government and the private sector), the importance of cash based programmes (in cash for work but also in supporting petty vendors and businesses), markets (working with them and not unfairly competing) and housing (considering trade offs between short term shelter and long term settlements and thinking about forms of rental). Building social and human capital is key, and in this response good programming approaches sought to do this in the relief stage, for example working with street food vendors to enhance food security. Some responses however tended to forget that cities contain readily available concentrations of skills and resources that, rather than being imported, might be found locally. Relief provided in camps sought to work through camp committees. Especially vulnerable people were often located and assisted, for example in the work of Age UK in the formation of a network of camp volunteers. The prolonged provision of services in camps however, such as water and healthcare, has been both expensive and has in some cases undermined pre-existing service providers who could not compete.},

Each participant was individually asked to imagine a series of incidents where a stimulus person inflicted (with little, some, or much intent) physical harm (little, some, or much) on another stimulus person. The participants rated the blameworthiness of the perpetrator's behavior in each of the nine incidents included in the complete bi-factorial design (3 \_ 3). It was found that Israelis of European descent tended to balance the weight of intent and damage while Israelis of Oriental descent from both ethnic- national backgrounds placed a greater emphasis on the damage that occurred.

Along similar lines, a more recent study from Israel suggested that a mother's functioning predicted her children's posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms for up to 5 years after exposure to missile attacks. Both observations point to two features of warfare that are of enduring importance to our field and are all too often neglected: war affects both children and parents and when it affects one, it often critically affects the other. Indeed, modern warfare is characterized by its civilian casualties. It is therefore fitting and timely that two articles in this issue of the Journal address the topic of adolescents affected by war.

Fifty-three social workers from two major hospitals in Israel filled out the Secondary Traumatization and Burnout subscales of the Compassion Fatigue Questionnaire, in addition to demographic details, professional experience, and participation in supervision or debriefing sessions. The results show that social workers had participated on average in 4.4 (SD 2.6) terror attacks. Of the social workers, 75.5\% had participated in debriefing sessions soon after the terror incident, and most had participated in individual or group supervision. They reported moderate levels of secondary traumatization and low levels of burnout. The latter outcome was related to participation in group supervision during the previous year. Secondary traumatization was not associated with the number of terror attacks, nor with demographic characteristics or professional degree or seniority, nor with having individual or group supervision or participation in debriefing. Despite the high number of terror events they attended, participants in the study proved relatively resilient to their effects. Compassion fatigue emerged as a state independent of a range of personal and situational characteristics.}

This method is often invoked by scholars who carry out within-case analysis based on qualitative data, yet frequently it is neither adequately understood nor rigorously applied. This deficit motivates this article, which offers a new framework for carrying out process tracing. The reformulation integrates discussions of process tracing and causal-process observations, gives greater attention to description as a key contribution, and emphasizes the causal sequence in which process-tracing observations can be situated. In the current period of major innovation in quantitative tools for causal inference, this reformulation is part of a wider, parallel effort to achieve greater systematization of qualitative methods. A key point here is that these methods can add inferential leverage that is often lacking in quantitative analysis.

  abstract = {This paper considers applications of disaster risk reduction (DRR) principles and operating mechanisms to migration influenced by environmental change. It is well established that DRR addresses change in risk, well-being and security including through adaptation and resilience building. However, the manner in which this applies to migration influenced by environmental change has to date not been well analysed. This is a multi-sectoral and inter-disciplinary field for which interpretation and consequent reactions to environmental change and migration involves technology, civil societal engagement, and political commitment. The paper presents implications for reacting to migration influenced by environmental change apparent from DRR principles of prevention, mitigation and post event response. Four operating mechanisms of DRR are also considered. They are early warning, risk management, improved communication and the use of appropriate response standards. The applicability and efficacy of these DRR principles and operating mechanisms for reacting to migration influenced by environmental change are conditioned by hazard uncertainty and potential impact. Disaster prevention or mitigation for those who move, host or stay behind involves community based risk reduction, resilience building, rights approaches, and migration as adaptation. The application of DRR to migration influenced by environmental change therefore highlights the importance of engaging localised strategies and well-being aspirations, and of knowing the limitations of humanitarian response in upholding rights and sustainable development outcomes. Whilst the development of DRR principles may analytically frame potential environmental migration responses, there are ongoing theoretical and applied challenges in this relationship. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Over the past 20 years, the development industry has changed rapidly and now presents evaluators with a series of new challenges.This article considers this process of change. It argues that there has been a move away from a `project-based' approach to a broader vision of development centred on the Millennium Development Goals, which has led to a change of the evaluation approach: from an assessment of outputs to an evaluation of results. Furthermore, the increasing complexity of ways in which the development process is conceptualized demands increasingly sophisticated and interpretive approaches to evaluation.Whilst there will remain space for positivist approaches in certain sectors of the industry, it is increasingly likely that other approaches will become more dominant.}

There are strong ethical grounds for simply asking those intended to benefit what happened to them, but it is not obvious how to do so in a way that is sufficiently free from bias in favour of confirming what is expected. This article considers scope for addressing this problem by minimizing the prior knowledge participants have of what is being evaluated. The tensions between more confirmatory and exploratory methodological approaches are reviewed in the light of experience of designing and piloting a qualitative impact assessment protocol for evaluating NGO interventions in complex rural livelihood transformations. The article concludes that resolving these tensions entails using mixed methodologies, and that the importance attached to exploratory (nested within confirmatory) approaches depends on contextual complexity, the type of evidence sought and the level of trust between stakeholders.},

The first is an analysis of ontological assumptions underpinning secondary literature on development policy at the national level. The second is the pilot testing of a combined ethnographic and psychometric approach to measuring individuals' perceptions of well-being. Congruence and disjuncture between the different views of well-being that emerge from this analysis are systematically explored, along with the potential for reducing such gaps as a means to improving development practise. The paper also examines the link between such analysis and the role of what Mignolo refers to as 'border thinking' within the geopolitics of knowledge. \textcopyright{} 2011 European Association of Development Research and Training Institutes.},

One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

Four standardized research instruments that measured trauma exposure, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology, complicated grief, anxiety, depression, well-being, and general mental health (a combined measure of well-being and psychological distress) were randomly disseminated among 500 Bosnian refugees with 126 (25\%) surveys returned. Results revealed PTSD (66.6\%), complicated grief (54\%), anxiety (40\%), and depression (31\%) symptoms in the clinical range. A sequential regression revealed that 31\% of the variance in poor general mental health was accounted for by complicated grief, whereas PTSD symptomatology only accounted for 6\% of the variance. Implications for mental health interventions, research, and policy are discussed.}

The panarchy framework is a hierarchical structure where natural systems and human systems are linked in non-stop adaptive cycles of growth, accumulation, restructuring, and renewal. These cycles occur in nested sets of ecological, temporal, and spatial resolutions and most occupy discrete niches in space or time. Within the model, structures and processes are also linked across scales. It is argued that the dynamics of a system at one particular scale of interest cannot be fully understood in lieu of accounting for the dynamics of other cross-scalar and hierarchical influences within the system.

  abstract = {Causal inference goes beyond prediction by modeling the outcome of interventions and formalizing counterfactual reasoning. Instead of restricting causal conclusions to experiments, causal inference explicates the conditions under which it is possible to draw causal conclusions even from observational data. In this paper, I provide a concise introduction to the graphical approach to causal inference, which uses Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to visualize, and Structural Causal Models (SCMs) to relate probabilistic and causal relationships. Successively, we climb what Judea Pearl calls the "causal hierarchy" --- moving from association to intervention to counterfactuals. I explain how DAGs can help us reason about associations between variables as well as interventions; how the do-calculus leads to a satisfactory definition of confounding, thereby clarifying, among other things, Simpson's paradox; and how SCMs enable us to reason about what could have been. Lastly, I discuss a number of challenges in applying causal inference in practice.},

Results showed that among women who survived the most severe traumas, the proportion of PTS was highest. High numbers of traumas, having children, being over 25 yrs of age, and the reporting of an absent husband, were characteristics associated with being a PTS case. Severe trauma and reporting of an absent husband remained significantly associated with PTS cases. The findings suggest that living in a continuous stressful and unsafe situation does not buffer the impact of major stressors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2005 APA, all rights reserved)},

Second, an amended version of the framework developed by J. B. Cousins and E. Whitmore (1998) is proposed as an alternative to current conceptualizations. This amended framework is then operationalized and adapted in a participation measurement instrument. The proposed conceptualization and instrument have the potential to contribute to the production of sound empirical knowledge about evaluation and to reflections on PE practice. \textcopyright{} 2009 American Evaluation Association.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The idea that underlying, generative mechanisms give rise to causal regularities has become a guiding principle across many social and natural science disciplines. A specific form of this enquiry, realist evaluation is gaining momentum in the evaluation of complex social interventions. It focuses on 'what works, how, in which conditions and for whom' using context, mechanism and outcome configurations as opposed to asking whether an intervention 'works'. Realist evaluation can be difficult to codify and requires considerable researcher reflection and creativity. As such there is often confusion when operationalising the method in practice. This article aims to clarify and further develop the concept of mechanism in realist evaluation and in doing so aid the learning of those operationalising the methodology.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nDISCUSSION: Using a social science illustration, we argue that disaggregating the concept of mechanism into its constituent parts helps to understand the difference between the resources offered by the intervention and the ways in which this changes the reasoning of participants. This in turn helps to distinguish between a context and mechanism. The notion of mechanisms 'firing' in social science research is explored, with discussions surrounding how this may stifle researchers' realist thinking. We underline the importance of conceptualising mechanisms as operating on a continuum, rather than as an 'on/off' switch. The discussions in this article will hopefully progress and operationalise realist methods. This development is likely to occur due to the infancy of the methodology and its recent increased profile and use in social science research. The arguments we present have been tested and are explained throughout the article using a social science illustration, evidencing their usability and value.},

  author = {Davies, Richard J},
  year = {1998},
  abstract = {The aim of this thesis is to develop a coherent theory of organisational learning which can generate practical means of assisting organisational learning. The thesis develops and applies this theory to one class of organisations known as non-government organisations (NGOs), and more specifically to those NGOs who receive funds from high income countries but who work for the benefit of the poor in low income countries. Of central concern are the processes whereby these NGOs learn from the rural and urban poor with whom they work. The basis of the theory of organisational learning used in this thesis is modern evolutionary theory, and more particularly, evolutionary epistemology. It is argued that this theory provides a means of both representing and assisting organisational learning. Firstly, it provides a simple definition of learning that can be operationalised at multiple scales of analysis: that of individuals, organisations, and populations of organisations. Differences in the forms of organisational learning that do take place can be represented using a number of observable attributes of learning which are derived from an interpretation of evolutionary theory. The same evolutionary theory can also provide useful explanations of processes thus defined and represented. Secondly, an analysis of organisational learning using these observable attributes and background theory also suggest two ways in which organisational learning can be assisted. One is the use of specific methods within NGOs: a type of participatory monitoring. The second is the use of particular interventions by their donors: demands for particular types of information which are indicative of how and where the NGO is learning},

MVA victims and 43 control participants were categorized by accident and attribution of responsibility for their accidents (selfresponsible, other-responsible, and control). Although initially all MVA victims reported higher levels of intrusive thoughts and were more likely to meet criteria for PTSD diagnoses, only other-responsible participants continued to demonstrate increased distress 6 and 12 months postaccident. Self-responsible participants used more self-blame coping than other-responsible participants, although within the self-responsible group, use of self-blame was associated with more distress. http://spider.apa.org/ftdocs/ccp/1997/august/ccp654560.html}

Interest has similarly grown in efforts to increase transparency, such as preregistration of hypotheses and methods, that seek to allay concerns that improved research designs do not address per se, such as publication bias and p-hacking. Yet, although these efforts improve the informativeness and interpretation of research results, relatively little attention has been paid to another practice that could help to achieve this goal: relating research findings to the views of the scientific community, policy-makers, and the general public. We suggest below three broad ways in which systematic collection of predictions of research results will prove useful: by improving the interpretation of research results, mitigating bias against null results, and improving predictive accuracy and experimental design.

This results in difficulties in walking and standing, and in an increased risk of falls. A proper control of the trunk is related to a stable walk and to a lower falling risk; to this extent, rehabilitative protocols are currently working on core stability. The main objective of this work was to evaluate the effectiveness of trunk and balance training performed with a new robotic device designed for evaluation and training of balance and core stability, in improving the recovery of chronic stroke patients compared with a traditional physical therapy program. Thirty chronic stroke patients, randomly divided in two groups, either underwent a traditional rehabilitative protocol, or a robot-based program. Each patient was assessed before and after the rehabilitation and at 3-months follow-up with clinical and robot-based evaluation exercises focused on static and dynamic balance and trunk control. Results from clinical scores showed an improvement in both groups in balance and trunk control. Robot-based indices analysis indicated that the experimental group showed greater improvements in proprioceptive control, reactive balance and postural control in unstable conditions, compared to the control group, showing an improved trunk control with reduced compensatory strategies at the end of the training. Moreover, the experimental group had an increased retention of the benefits obtained with training at 3 months follow up. These results support the idea that such robotic device is a promising tool for stroke rehabilitation.},

This papers aims to systematically review quantitative studies examining the association between social capital and mental illness. Twenty electronic databases and the reference sections of papers were searched to identify published studies. Authors of papers were contacted for unpublished work. Anonymised papers were reviewed by the authors of this paper. Papers with a validated mental illness outcome and an exposure variable agreed as measuring social capital were included. No limitations were put on date or language of publication. Twenty one studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. Fourteen measured social capital at the individual level and seven at an ecological level. The former offered evidence for an inverse relation between cognitive social capital and common mental disorders. There was moderate evidence for an inverse relation between cognitive social capital and child mental illness, and combined measures of social capital and common mental disorders. The seven ecological studies were diverse in methodology, populations investigated, and mental illness outcomes, making them difficult to summarise. Individual and ecological social capital may measure different aspects of the social environment. Current evidence is inadequate to inform the development of specific social capital interventions to combat mental illness.},

Social capital may explain some of the geographical variation in CMD, but the association between social capital and CMD in low income countries has rarely been studied. This paper aims to explore the relationship between individual and ecological measures of social capital and maternal CMD in four low income countries. Cross-sectional data from the Young Lives (YL) study with information across 234 communities in Peru, Ethiopia, Vietnam and Andhra Pradesh (India) were used. The mental health of mothers of one-year-old children (n=6909), and the individual cognitive and structural social capital of all respondents was assessed. Ecological social capital was calculated by aggregating individual responses to the community level. Multi-level modelling was used to explore the association between individual and ecological (community level) social capital and maternal CMD in each of the four countries, adjusting for a wide range of individual and community level confounders. The analysis shows that individual cognitive social capital is associated with reduced odds of CMD across all four countries. The results for structural social capital are more mixed and culturally specific, with some aspects associated with increased odds of CMD. This suggests that structural social capital has context-specific effects and cognitive social capital more universal effects on maternal CMD.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Medical Research Councils' framework for complex interventions has been criticized for not including theory-driven approaches to evaluation. Although the framework does include broad guidance on the use of theory, it contains little practical guidance for implementers and there have been calls to develop a more comprehensive approach. A prospective, theory-driven process of intervention design and evaluation is required to develop complex healthcare interventions which are more likely to be effective, sustainable and scalable. METHODS: We propose a theory-driven approach to the design and evaluation of complex interventions by adapting and integrating a programmatic design and evaluation tool, Theory of Change (ToC), into the MRC framework for complex interventions. We provide a guide to what ToC is, how to construct one, and how to integrate its use into research projects seeking to design, implement and evaluate complex interventions using the MRC framework. We test this approach by using ToC within two randomized controlled trials and one non-randomized evaluation of complex interventions. RESULTS: Our application of ToC in three research projects has shown that ToC can strengthen key stages of the MRC framework. It can aid the development of interventions by providing a framework for enhanced stakeholder engagement and by explicitly designing an intervention that is embedded in the local context. For the feasibility and piloting stage, ToC enables the systematic identification of knowledge gaps to generate research questions that strengthen intervention design. ToC may improve the evaluation of interventions by providing a comprehensive set of indicators to evaluate all stages of the causal pathway through which an intervention achieves impact, combining evaluations of intervention effectiveness with detailed process evaluations into one theoretical framework. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating a ToC approach into the MRC framework holds promise for improving the design and evaluation of complex interventions, thereby increasing the likelihood that the intervention will be ultimately effective, sustainable and scalable. We urge researchers developing and evaluating complex interventions to consider using this approach, to evaluate its usefulness and to build an evidence base to further refine the methodology.

  abstract = {This article describes the role of psychosocial support programs in American Red Cross-sponsored humanitarian assistance efforts in international disasters. The American Red Cross psychosocial support program consists of four specific components: participatory crisis assessment, dealing with survivors' root shock, community mobilization, and community development. The program is predicated on the assumption that after a disaster, survivors lose their sense of "place". Psychosocial community programs are based on outreach activities by local practitioners trained and supported by the American Red Cross. The approach sees psychological advantages to survivors of continuing to mobilize their own resources; familiarity, trust, and human capital build. The community members themselves decide the steps they are going to take to reestablish "place," thus becoming active participants in reducing the traumatic stress caused by the disaster. The article concludes with three actions that signal successful integration of psychosocial support programs into multisector responses to disasters: reestablishment of a sense of place, community mobilization, and taking actions that lead to a sense of physical and psychological well-being.

  abstract = {During the 19th century, a picture was painted of trauma in which the focus was on pathologies of the victims, including notions of inherited "moral degeneracy," with little cognizance of the greater contextual factors, such as the traumatic events themselves, that contributed to the symptom picture. The role of trauma in the etiology of posttraumatic symptoms was incorporated into the DSM-III in 1980 and the PTSD category was initially viewed as an improvement over earlier categorizations of trauma, as it acknowledged that some experiences are so overwhelming that few people would escape unscathed. However, recent findings that not all persons who have suffered traumatic events develop PTSD have led some writers to discussion of a genetic component to PTSD. This article looks at this conclusion and the role of individual and contextual factors in relation to PTSD, Complex PTSD, and revictimization.}

Traditional data analyses approaches (e.g., correlation or multiple regression) are not appropriate for testing or inducing such statements. This article proposes necessary condition analysis (NCA) as a general and straightforward methodology for identifying necessary conditions in data sets. The article presents the logic and methodology of necessary but not sufficient contributions of organizational determinants (e.g., events, characteristics, resources, efforts) to a desired outcome (e.g., good performance). A necessary determinant must be present for achieving an outcome, but its presence is not sufficient to obtain that outcome. Without the necessary condition, there is guaranteed failure, which cannot be compensated by other determinants of the outcome. This logic and its related methodology are fundamentally different from the traditional sufficiency-based logic and methodology. Practical recommendations and free software are offered to support researchers to apply NCA.},

Ehlers and Clark [A cognitive model of persistent posttraumatic stem disorder Behav. Res. Ther. 38 (2000) 319-345] recently proposed a cognitive model of maintenance. The current study aimed to investigate several cognitive factors highlighted in Ehlers and Clark's model using a prospective design. Fifty-seven victims of physical or sexual assault participated in the study. Cognitive factors were assessed within 4 months of assault and victims were followed-up 6 and 9 months after the assault. Cognitive variables which significantly predicted PTSD severity at both follow-ups were: cognitive processing style during assault (mental defeat, mental confusion, detachment); appraisal of assault sequelae (appraisal of symptoms, perceived negative responses of others, permanent change); negative beliefs about self and world; and maladaptive control strategies (avoidance/safety seeking). Relationships between early appraisals, control strategies, and processing styles and subsequent PTSD severity remained significant after statistically controlling for gender and perceived assault severity. These findings support the cognitive model of PTSD proposed by Ehlers and Clark and suggest that effective treatment will need to address these cognitive factors.}

In this article it is discussed whether some of this critique reflects a continuation of a denial of trauma and PTSD that has been evident in psychology and psychiatry for a number of years. Although the critique has rightfully pointed out the importance of social and political dimensions in the understanding of trauma, it is argued that some aspects of trauma are universal. The critique has also focused on the use of western models of therapy in non-western societies. However, work done in this field has often adopted a community-based model focusing on large groups of people affected by war situations rather than using medical therapy models. Thus the critique has been somewhat misplaced. Especially in helping children in war it is important not to accept the local culture too much but to rely on children's inborn resilience and cultural traditions for preventing long-term traumatic stress.}

  abstract = {More and more, development organizations are under pressure to demonstrate that their programs result in significant and lasting changes in the well-being of their intended beneficiaries. However, such "impacts" are often the product of a confluence of events for which no single agency or group of agencies can realistically claim full credit. As a result, assessing development impacts is problematic, yet many organizations continue to struggle to measure results far beyond the reach of their programs. Outcome Mapping recognizes that development is essentially about people relating to each other and their environment. The originality of this approach lies in its shift away from assessing the products of a program to focus on changes in behaviour, relationships, actions, and activities in the people, groups, and organizations it works with directly. In doing so, Outcome Mapping debunks many of the myths about measuring impact. It will help a program be specific about the actors it targets, the changes it expects to see, and the strategies it employs and, as a result, be more effective in terms of the results it achieves. This publication explains the various steps in the outcome mapping approach and provides detailed information on workshop design and facilitation. It includes numerous worksheets and examples.},

"As noted above, cause maps are directed graphs. They are therefore characterized by an hierarchical structure which is most often in the form of a means/ ends graph. However the hierarchical form of a map is often destroyed by circularity in which a chain of means and ends loops back on itselc indeed circularity is often regarded as the fundamental structural characteristic of a map" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNLP64PY?page=2}{Eden et al 1992:310})
\par
"For representational purposes a cause map is usually drawn as short pieces of text linked with unidirectional arrows. In the general case, a statement at the tail of an arrow is taken to cause the statement at the arrow head. For cognitive maps the causality is less precise and relates, by implication, the first phrase of a bi-polar construct to the first phrase of the second construct. When an arrow head has a -ve sign attached then the first pole of the tail construct implies the second pole of the head construct. Typically a node (or construct) which has no implication (out-arrows) is referred to as a 'head', and a node which has no in-arrows is referred to as a 'tail'. Figure 1 shows a typical cognitive map." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNLP64PY?page=2}{Eden et al 1992:310})

\par
"If a map is to be any sort of reflection of an individual's cognition (but see Eden, 1992 in this volume) then it must be distinctively different from the map of any other individual's cognition. If maps are the same across several persons then it is possible to conclude that each person construes the world in the same way as another. Clearly at some level this must be true for there to be a social construction of reality" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNLP64PY?page=6}{Eden et al 1992:314})

The male subjects (n = 854) were members of the Stanford-Terman study, and 38\% served in World War II. Cox models (proportional-hazards regressions) were used to compare the relative mortality risk associated with each military experience. Overseas duty, service in the Pacific theater, and exposure to combat significantly increased the mortality risks of veterans in the study. Individual differences in education, mental health in 1950, and age at entry into the military, as well as personality factors, made no difference in these results. In conclusion, a gradient was observed such that active duty on the home front, followed by overseas duty, service in the Pacific, and combat exposure, markedly increased the risk for relatively early mortality. Potential linking mechanisms include heavy drinking.}

  author = {Elder, S},

  volume = {1},
  abstract = {Introduction The share of youth which are neither in employment nor in education or training in the youth population (the so-called " NEET rate ") is a relatively new indicator, but one that is given increasing importance by international organizations and the media. The popularity of the " NEET " concept is associated with its assumed potential to address a broad array of vulnerabilities among youth, touching on issues of unemployment, early school leaving and labour market discouragement. These are all issues that warrant greater attention as young people continue to feel the aftermath of the economic crisis, particularly in advanced economies. From a little known indicator aimed at focusing attention on the issue of school drop-out among teenagers in the early 2000s, the indicator has gained enough weight to be proposed as the sole youth-specific target for the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 8 to " Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all " . Within the Goal, youth are identified in two proposed targets: (i) by 2030 achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value, and (ii) by 2020 substantially reduce the proportion of youth not in employment, education or training (NEET). It is the author's opinion that the NEET rate is an indicator that is widely misunderstood and therefore misinterpreted. The critique which follows is intended to point out some misconceptions so that the indicator can be framed around what it really measures, rather than what it does not. If the indicator is to be placed within the post-2015 SDG framework then a great deal of work remains to be done in educating policymakers, international organizations and the public as to what the NEETs mean. This analytical brief, based on an analysis of the recent School-to-work transition surveys (SWTS) from 28 low-and middle-income countries, hopes to contribute to a better understanding of this ambiguous indicator.},

Factor analysis was supportive of a four-factor solution with the elimination of the Protective function and the emergence of a new function, Enrichment. The validity of a new structure, the Faith-Based Volunteer Motivation Scale, is tested against levels of volunteer satisfaction for this sample. Results concur with Clary et al.'s correlation between high-level motive fulfilment and degrees of satisfaction.},

Developmental history, personality, social support, and PTSD measures from two earlier time points were used to predict current scores on the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI). We hypothesized positive predictive relationships between PTGI indices and trauma exposure (and corresponding distress levels), positive affect, and social support. Positive Affectivity, Constraint, and two Social Support measures followed a pattern of significant and near-significant positive correlations with PTGI total score, Relationships with Others, and Spiritual Change, suggesting multidirectional relationships among these variables. POW trauma exposure correlated with Perceived Strength. Regression analyses significantly predicted PTGI total score, Improved Relationships, and Spiritual Change. The results both lend support to and raise questions about the construct validity of the PTGI.}

Morphological inquiries elaborate causal arguments by uncovering patterns in the empirical layout of socio-historical phenomena. To this end, these inquiries draw on descriptive techniques of data formalization. Variable-centered studies engage causal issues by investigating patterns of association among empirical categories under the twofold assumption that these categories a priori have explanatory relevance and each category empirically has the same meaning across cases. Genetic analyses ground their causal claims by identifying patterned processes of emergence or production.},

  abstract = {Recent research has questioned the usefulness of Vector Autoregression (VAR) models as a description of monetary policy, especially in light of the low correlation between forecast errors from VARs and those derived from Fed funds futures rates. This paper presents three findings on VARs' ability to describe monetary policy. First, the correlation between forecast errors is a misleading measure of how closely the VAR forecast mimics the futures market's. In particular, the low correlation is partly due to a weak positive correlation between the VAR forecasts and the futures market errors. Second, Fed funds rate forecasts from common VAR specifications do tend to be noisy, but this can be remedied by estimating more parsimonious models on post-1982 data. Third, time aggregation problems caused by the structure of the Fed funds futures market can distort the timing and magnitude of shocks derived from futures rates, and complicate comparisons with VAR-based forecasts.},

But the magnitude of these effects is small. We find no statistically significant average effect of treatment on the price received by farmers, crop value-added, crop losses resulting from rainstorms, or the likelihood of changing crop varieties and cultivation practices. Although disappointing, these results are in line with the market take-up rate of the RML service in the study districts, which shows small numbers of clients in aggregate and a relative stagnation in take-up over the study period.},

A culturally grounded methodology using qualitative data was used to develop and validate the Sri Lankan Index of Psychosocial Status--Adult Version (SLIPSS-A). The SLIPPS-A is a 26-item measure assessing local indicators of distress, with items placed on a frequency scale from 0 (never) to 4 (6-7 days per week). The instrument was administered to 170 Sinhalese Sri Lankans (72\% women) between the ages of 21 and 71 years with differing types of trauma exposure. The measure demonstrated excellent reliability (a = .92) and was significantly correlated with the Postraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist. Scores on the SLIPSS-A significantly predicted exposure to the tsunami. Factor analysis resulted in the extraction of five factors. The results suggest that the SLIPSS-A could be used as a general measure to assess psychosocial functioning in Sri Lankan rural Sinhalese adults impacted by trauma.

These are home to nearly one third of the population and 70\% of the livestock herd." (Fitzgibbon 2012:1) "In the vast northern districts of Turkana, Marsabit, Wajir and Mandera between 74\% - 97\% of people live below the absolute poverty line" (Fitzgibbon 2012:1) very detailed and thorough (note on p.1) "Coordination of Drought Emergencies in Kenya Kenya has a draft Disaster Management Policy however no official policy or legal framework exists.to guide disaster management." (Fitzgibbon 2012:3) "The Government and relevant stakeholders, including the Kenyan population in general and disasteraffected populations in particular, have in the past managed disasters reasonably well, courtesy of the multi-sectoral and multi-agency approach." (Fitzgibbon 2012:3) "The UN cluster system has been activated from time to time, primarily after the post-election violence in 2008. Clusters vary considerably in their levels of activity and effectiveness." (Fitzgibbon 2012:3) "Clusters are often primarily focused on the humanitarian needs of the 500,000 refugees in Kenya, mostly located in the camps at Dadaab and Kakuma." (Fitzgibbon 2012:3) "Some argue that examination of long term rainfall patterns and NDVI 4 data for Kenya show the frequency of drought and erratic rainfall has not change" (Fitzgibbon 2012:3) "It seems clear that even if the intensity of droughts is not increasing currently, the economic, social and other impacts on Kenya are increasing." (Fitzgibbon 2012:3) "Pastoralist and agropastoralists are also characterised by being wholly or semi-nomadic. This means they differ from mixed or sedentary farmers in that "most of the food their livestock eats is natural forage rather than cultivated fodders or pastures". It is now more widely acknowledged that pastoralists are astute land managers whose mobility enables them to make the most productive use of drought-prone rangelands." (Fitzgibbon 2012:4) "Despite this, pastoralism is only beginning to be accepted as a valuable economic production system. For many decades governments perceived pastoralists as "backward", economically inefficient and environmentally destructive." (Fitzgibbon 2012:5) " Land fragmentation: pastoral mobility is increasingly restrained as land is converted for agriculture or ranching, is invaded by non-local plants, is enclosed for individual use, or removed to become a protected area 9 . Poor land use planning means dry season grazing areas and water points are no longer accessible to pastoral herders" (Fitzgibbon 2012:5) " Population increase: Populations in the ASAL areas of Kenya have increased dramatically in the last two decades. For example the population of North Eastern Province increase six fold between 1989 and 2009 from 371,000 to 2.3 million. Clearly it will be difficult for this delicate eco-system to support such numbers by pastoralism alone." (Fitzgibbon 2012:5) " Low literacy and education provision: Rates of retention, survival and completion in Northern Kenya are way below the rest of the country." (Fitzgibbon 2012:6) " Poor infrastructure: ASAL areas have the lowest proportion of tarmac or quality roads in the Kenya, only one town (Isiolo) is connected to the national grid" (Fitzgibbon 2012:6) " Weak market integration: Poor infrastructure leads to inflated prices for food and other basic commodities as a result of high transportation costs" (Fitzgibbon 2012:6) "What is the cost of humanitarian response? There is a direct financial cost associated with responding to each drought episode." (Fitzgibbon 2012:7) "Over the last decade the amount of international humanitarian aid to Kenya has been tracked annually by UNOCHA 13" (Fitzgibbon 2012:7) "The Wider Costs of Drought Emergencies on Kenya The regular and periodic droughts (and floods) experienced in Kenya clearly have major socioeconomic impacts and reduce economic growth" (Fitzgibbon 2012:8) "The first attempt to systematically quantify the economic impact of drought was done earlier this year when the Government of Kenya completed a Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) 16 for the extended 2008-2011 drought period." (Fitzgibbon 2012:8) "3.2 National Level - What is the cost of early response? Costing early response from a national perspective is not easy as any response clearly incorporates a range of interventions some of which occur earlier than others. Generally national drought responses have rarely been described as timely and criticisms of late response abound 19 ." (Fitzgibbon 2012:10) "Arid Lands Resource Management Project (ALRMP) At the national level on-going government support for drought response in Kenya has been the remit of the Arid Lands Resource Management Project (ALRMP). This Government led programme established in 1996 with on-going funding from the World Bank (and other donors)." (Fitzgibbon 2012:10) "Unfortunately donor funding to the ASALs was significantly reduced when the ALRMP closed down at the end of 2010. In the last year the Government has launched a new National Drought Management Authority (N" (Fitzgibbon 2012:11) "Despite this drought response in Kenya cannot be described as timely and is still heavily reliant on the short and long rains assessment reports." (Fitzgibbon 2012:11) "3.3 National Level - What is the cost of resilience? Given the wide range of interventions that could be described as resilience, this cost is difficult to assess at the national level. However recently, a couple of national estimates have been developed. These include the following:" (Fitzgibbon 2012:11) " Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) 21 - in addition to quantifying the damages and losses resulting from the drought the PDNA calculated the disaster risk reduction (DRR) needs of each sector assessed." (Fitzgibbon 2012:11) "Table 6: Estimated 5 years Costs of Implementing Mid-Term Implementation Plan of Ministry of Northern Kenya (US\$ million)" (Fitzgibbon 2012:13) "Kenya has a plethora of national, sectoral and ministerial development plans. The primary national plan is Kenya Vision 2030 which forms the long-term development blue print for the country." (Fitzgibbon 2012:13) "Only North Eastern Province is wholly arid. The stark differences in social indicators for this province are clear but it is also the least populated province. When national budgets are being developed there is a strong tendency to allocate funds to districts on the basis of population. Although there has been some effort to prioritise CDF and LATF 23 budgets to the poorest areas (which includes arid districts) these additional funds are actually very small when compared with Government's annual revenue spending in a less vulnerable location." (Fitzgibbon 2012:13) "National Expenditure on Resilience by International Donors Despite the high profile of drought emergencies in Kenya, even international donor funding is also inherently skewed towards non-ASAL areas. For example USAID is by far the largest humanitarian donor to Kenya providing over US\$231m to the drought crisis in 2011 (the majority of this was for food aid). It can be assumed the majority of this was directed to the ASAL areas (which also includes refugees in Kenyan camps). Although this represented 33\% of the total international response it still represents less than 20\% of total US funding to Kenya that focuses almost exclusively on the high potential areas." (Fitzgibbon 2012:14) "3.4 District and Project Level Cost Comparisons At a sub-national level it is easier to assess the relative costs of the three response categories, identified by the study, from a sectoral perspective." (Fitzgibbon 2012:14) "If the costs per beneficiary are doubled to crudely reflect a 12 month period they are actually almost exactly the same at \$54.83 as the current WFP food relief cost per person. The added benefit being the timeliness of the transfer prevents asset erosion and the size of payment is modified to reflect the differing need of various local livelihoods and wealth groups." (Fitzgibbon 2012:16) "such programmes would be less expensive per beneficiary (US\$45) than the current estimated cost of food aid and the figure assessed using HEA modelling. However the coverage levels proposed are much higher (\{\$\textbackslash backslash\$textgreater\}80\% of the population) than those normally allocated food aid (approximately 15-30\%) resulting in a greater absolute cost." (Fitzgibbon 2012:16) "The initial registration of the proposed HSNP households in northern Kenya will begin shortly. Each household will be issued with an electronic 'smart card / e-voucher'. It would clearly be practical and efficient if WFP's PRRO food assistance pipeline could be distributed using the same card (and also using private distribution agents and traders in the mode of the HSNP)." (Fitzgibbon 2012:16) "Seasonal HEA Outcome Analysis for Northern Kenya: July 2011: Save the Children UK" (Fitzgibbon 2012:16) "Using Food and Cash Transfers to Build Resilience - The extent to which food and cash transfers alone ever truly build resilience, is a topic of heated debate. It can be argued that transfers to individual households can build their resilience if given at the right level i.e. the livelihood threshold which prevents households from eating into assets at times of stress." (Fitzgibbon 2012:18) "Conversely it can be argued that protecting assets does not build resilience but merely maintains the status quo and the household will need the same level of assistance in the next crisis." (Fitzgibbon 2012:18) "This would mean the household is more resilient in the face of the current crisis because of the transfer but not necessarily resilient to future, repeated crisis without the transfer. Ultimately the test of a good resilience building activity is one which reduces the caseload of beneficiaries in need of food or cash subsidies via any modality." (Fitzgibbon 2012:18) "Food for work programmes have been expanding in Kenya recently, particularly through the WFP Food for Assets programme (FFA) whereby communities are provided with food in exchange for their participation in works that strengthen their self-sufficiency and create assets that improve their food security." (Fitzgibbon 2012:18) "This has proven to stimulate markets with traders increasing incomes, turnover and trade in remote market locations. In addition, imported pulses in the food ration were substituted for vouchers for local food products (namely milk, meat and fish) purchased from local producers. This worked to provide a guaranteed local market for producers, many of whom were food aid beneficiaries throughout the drought period 34 ." (Fitzgibbon 2012:18) "Water emerges as the priority need for almost all drought affected communities. Although it does not represent the most significant humanitarian response cost, WASH interventions are the most frequent, widespread and regular." (Fitzgibbon 2012:18) "In total Government of Kenya provided nearly Ksh 1.2 billion (US\$14 million) in emergency water assistance which is twice that provided by the international community (US\$7.2m)." (Fitzgibbon 2012:19) "crude annual average cost of US\$1.87 per head. Clearly this cost only includes that recorded as emergency response and is divided by the entire population of the drought affected districts although only a small proportion benefited." (Fitzgibbon 2012:19) "When asked about the most useful and effective emergency response, beneficiaries regularly cite water tankering." (Fitzgibbon 2012:19) "WESCOORD members have agreed that emergency water tankering (i.e. paid for by GoK or agency humanitarian funds) should only be undertaken when human life is at risk. This is not always the case and many of the water tankering projects assessed in the 2009 assessment provided water for livestock. Very often livestock owners buy water for their herds raising the necessary resources from the sale of animals (see livestock section below). Livestock mortality is very often a factor of lack of water for herds." (Fitzgibbon 2012:19) "Quantifying the millions spent privately by families and pastoral producers on private water tankering to ensure their own and their herds survival is difficult." (Fitzgibbon 2012:20) "Given water is a perennial issue in ASAL areas, it regularly emerges as the primary concern when communities are facilitated to undertake risk and vulnerability assessments 37 . Consequently many NGOs have supported communities to develop appropriate, sustainable water sources, and build their capacity to manage and maintain them even through severe drought episodes." (Fitzgibbon 2012:20) "It is important to note that not all communities require emergency water tankering during drought periods. The majority of locations in the ASALs cope. These communities will usually have strategic water reserves in place e.g. dry season boreholes or reserve tanks." (Fitzgibbon 2012:20) "What all agencies supporting community water schemes stress is that establishing an effective WUA takes time and requires on-going support. It is considered impossible to establish a sustainable water user association within the timeframe of a humanitarian grant (12- 18 months maximum)." (Fitzgibbon 2012:20) xi really interesting - water resources would be really wanted and required by a minority of communities but overlaps in complex ways with private purchase of water eg for livestock. it is a long-term intervention cos you need to get community groups goingWhat all agencies supporting community water schemes stress is that establishing an effective WUA takes time and requires on-going support. It is considered impossible to establish a sustainable water user association within the timeframe of a humanitarian grant (12-18 months maximum). (note on p.20) "In discussions with NGOs 39 engaged in long term community water programmes it was considered reasonable to cost such projects over 10 years to ensure 'resilience'. Since water forms the foundation of all other community based DRR programming, this expenditure should also facilitate and support communities to undertake a range of complementary (and often low cost) activities." (Fitzgibbon 2012:21) "The Wider Costs and Benefits of Community Managed WASH programmes So are community managed water schemes a more cost effective approach? Some may argue that well managed and sustainable community water schemes function on a cost recovery basis and therefore should be generating sufficient income to cover operational costs long before 10 years." (Fitzgibbon 2012:21) "Anecdotally there is wide support for community managed and supported risk reduction programmes. Unfortunately there is limited cost data to undertake a more rigorous cost analysis." (Fitzgibbon 2012:22) " Animal Health - precisely the same interventions are proposed however vaccination campaigns undertaken before the drought has affected animals' body condition is far more effective than vaccination during a drought." (Fitzgibbon 2012:23) "Assessing the Wider Costs and Benefits - Livestock Reducing livestock mortality is essential given the sector represents such a high proportion of all damage and losses incurred 50 during drought periods. The livestock mortality experienced in recent droughts has resulted in increasing numbers of pastoral 'drop-outs' i.e. households that can no longer make ends meet from raising livestock alone. These households form the most chronically food insecure group increasingly reliant on food aid and cash safety nets for survival year round." (Fitzgibbon 2012:28) "The loss of milk from the pastoral diet during dry periods is thought to be one of the biggest factors affecting the chronically high child malnutrition rates in pastoral areas 5" (Fitzgibbon 2012:28) also a lot of stuff on livestock (note on p.28) "3.5.4 Other Interventions There is an endless array of interventions that can be undertaken in responding to humanitarian crisis and / or to build resilience. An indicative list is given below:  Expanding / Diversification of Livelihood activities" (Fitzgibbon 2012:29) " Expand basic and social services o Expanded coverage and completion of education" (Fitzgibbon 2012:30) " Expansion of wider scale infrastructure o Roads" (Fitzgibbon 2012:30) "Table 15: Example Costs and Benefits of Livelihood Diversification Schemes in ASALs of Kenya" (Fitzgibbon 2012:32) "Tana River Irrigation scheme (ICRC)" (Fitzgibbon 2012:32) " Scaling up Most projects work at the community level and few have more than 5,000 beneficiaries and many far fewer." (Fitzgibbon 2012:33) " Long term income levels The incomes reported from diversification projects vary widely. In fact it was extremely difficult to identify projects for this study that could readily supply any beneficiary income data. Several agencies admitted they had never done any income monitoring so just do not know." (Fitzgibbon 2012:33) " Support for sustainability There is broad agreement that the successful establishment of community based enterprises in very poor or marginal areas requires a certain level of support." (Fitzgibbon 2012:33) "If an ASAL-wide database of livelihood projects were created many of these issues could be monitored on a long term basis." (Fitzgibbon 2012:33) "There is much evidence to show that education, especially of girls, is a key factor in improving family and child health and nutrition indicators. In addition to its many intrinsic benefits, education is one of the most important livelihood diversification strategies."

These are home to nearly one third of the population and 70\% of the livestock herd."

(Fitzgibbon 2012:3) "The Government and relevant stakeholders, including the Kenyan population in general and disasteraffected populations in particular, have in the past managed disasters reasonably well, courtesy of the multi-sectoral and multi-agency approach." (Fitzgibbon 2012:3) "The UN cluster system has been activated from time to time, primarily after the post-election violence in 2008. Clusters vary considerably in their levels of activity and effectiveness." (Fitzgibbon 2012:3) "Clusters are often primarily focused on the humanitarian needs of the 500,000 refugees in Kenya, mostly located in the camps at Dadaab and Kakuma." (Fitzgibbon 2012:3) "Some argue that examination of long term rainfall patterns and NDVI 4 data for Kenya show the frequency of drought and erratic rainfall has not change" (Fitzgibbon 2012:3) "It seems clear that even if the intensity of droughts is not increasing currently, the economic, social and other impacts on Kenya are increasing." (Fitzgibbon 2012:3) "Pastoralist and agropastoralists are also characterised by being wholly or semi-nomadic. This means they differ from mixed or sedentary farmers in that "most of the food their livestock eats is natural forage rather than cultivated fodders or pastures". It is now more widely acknowledged that pastoralists are astute land managers whose mobility enables them to make the most productive use of drought-prone rangelands." (Fitzgibbon 2012:4) "Despite this, pastoralism is only beginning to be accepted as a valuable economic production system. For many decades governments perceived pastoralists as "backward", economically inefficient and environmentally destructive." (Fitzgibbon 2012:5) " Land fragmentation: pastoral mobility is increasingly restrained as land is converted for agriculture or ranching, is invaded by non-local plants, is enclosed for individual use, or removed to become a protected area 9 . Poor land use planning means dry season grazing areas and water points are no longer accessible to pastoral herders" (Fitzgibbon 2012:5) " Population increase: Populations in the ASAL areas of Kenya have increased dramatically in the last two decades. For example the population of North Eastern Province increase six fold between 1989 and 2009 from 371,000 to 2.3 million. Clearly it will be difficult for this delicate eco-system to support such numbers by pastoralism alone." (Fitzgibbon 2012:5) " Low literacy and education provision: Rates of retention, survival and completion in Northern Kenya are way below the rest of the country." (Fitzgibbon 2012:6) " Poor infrastructure: ASAL areas have the lowest proportion of tarmac or quality roads in the Kenya, only one town (Isiolo) is connected to the national grid" (Fitzgibbon 2012:6) " Weak market integration: Poor infrastructure leads to inflated prices for food and other basic commodities as a result of high transportation costs" (Fitzgibbon 2012:6) "What is the cost of humanitarian response? There is a direct financial cost associated with responding to each drought episode." (Fitzgibbon 2012:7) "Over the last decade the amount of international humanitarian aid to Kenya has been tracked annually by UNOCHA 13" (Fitzgibbon 2012:7) "The Wider Costs of Drought Emergencies on Kenya The regular and periodic droughts (and floods) experienced in Kenya clearly have major socioeconomic impacts and reduce economic growth" (Fitzgibbon 2012:8) "The first attempt to systematically quantify the economic impact of drought was done earlier this year when the Government of Kenya completed a Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) 16 for the extended 2008-2011 drought period." (Fitzgibbon 2012:8) "3.2 National Level - What is the cost of early response? Costing early response from a national perspective is not easy as any response clearly incorporates a range of interventions some of which occur earlier than others. Generally national drought responses have rarely been described as timely and criticisms of late response abound 19 ." (Fitzgibbon 2012:10) "Arid Lands Resource Management Project (ALRMP) At the national level on-going government support for drought response in Kenya has been the remit of the Arid Lands Resource Management Project (ALRMP). This Government led programme established in 1996 with on-going funding from the World Bank (and other donors)." (Fitzgibbon 2012:10) "Unfortunately donor funding to the ASALs was significantly reduced when the ALRMP closed down at the end of 2010. In the last year the Government has launched a new National Drought Management Authority (N" (Fitzgibbon 2012:11) "Despite this drought response in Kenya cannot be described as timely and is still heavily reliant on the short and long rains assessment reports." (Fitzgibbon 2012:11) "3.3 National Level - What is the cost of resilience? Given the wide range of interventions that could be described as resilience, this cost is difficult to assess at the national level. However recently, a couple of national estimates have been developed. These include the following:" (Fitzgibbon 2012:11) " Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) 21 - in addition to quantifying the damages and losses resulting from the drought the PDNA calculated the disaster risk reduction (DRR) needs of each sector assessed." (Fitzgibbon 2012:11) "Table 6: Estimated 5 years Costs of Implementing Mid-Term Implementation Plan of Ministry of Northern Kenya (US\$ million)" (Fitzgibbon 2012:13) "Kenya has a plethora of national, sectoral and ministerial development plans. The primary national plan is Kenya Vision 2030 which forms the long-term development blue print for the country." (Fitzgibbon 2012:13) "Only North Eastern Province is wholly arid. The stark differences in social indicators for this province are clear but it is also the least populated province. When national budgets are being developed there is a strong tendency to allocate funds to districts on the basis of population. Although there has been some effort to prioritise CDF and LATF 23 budgets to the poorest areas (which includes arid districts) these additional funds are actually very small when compared with Government's annual revenue spending in a less vulnerable location." (Fitzgibbon 2012:13) "National Expenditure on Resilience by International Donors Despite the high profile of drought emergencies in Kenya, even international donor funding is also inherently skewed towards non-ASAL areas. For example USAID is by far the largest humanitarian donor to Kenya providing over US\$231m to the drought crisis in 2011 (the majority of this was for food aid). It can be assumed the majority of this was directed to the ASAL areas (which also includes refugees in Kenyan camps). Although this represented 33\% of the total international response it still represents less than 20\% of total US funding to Kenya that focuses almost exclusively on the high potential areas." (Fitzgibbon 2012:14) "3.4 District and Project Level Cost Comparisons At a sub-national level it is easier to assess the relative costs of the three response categories, identified by the study, from a sectoral perspective." (Fitzgibbon 2012:14) "If the costs per beneficiary are doubled to crudely reflect a 12 month period they are actually almost exactly the same at \$54.83 as the current WFP food relief cost per person. The added benefit being the timeliness of the transfer prevents asset erosion and the size of payment is modified to reflect the differing need of various local livelihoods and wealth groups." (Fitzgibbon 2012:16) "such programmes would be less expensive per beneficiary (US\$45) than the current estimated cost of food aid and the figure assessed using HEA modelling. However the coverage levels proposed are much higher (\{\$\textbackslash backslash\$textgreater\}80\% of the population) than those normally allocated food aid (approximately 15-30\%) resulting in a greater absolute cost." (Fitzgibbon 2012:16) "The initial registration of the proposed HSNP households in northern Kenya will begin shortly. Each household will be issued with an electronic 'smart card / e-voucher'. It would clearly be practical and efficient if WFP's PRRO food assistance pipeline could be distributed using the same card (and also using private distribution agents and traders in the mode of the HSNP)." (Fitzgibbon 2012:16) "Seasonal HEA Outcome Analysis for Northern Kenya: July 2011: Save the Children UK" (Fitzgibbon 2012:16) "Using Food and Cash Transfers to Build Resilience - The extent to which food and cash transfers alone ever truly build resilience, is a topic of heated debate. It can be argued that transfers to individual households can build their resilience if given at the right level i.e. the livelihood threshold which prevents households from eating into assets at times of stress." (Fitzgibbon 2012:18) "Conversely it can be argued that protecting assets does not build resilience but merely maintains the status quo and the household will need the same level of assistance in the next crisis." (Fitzgibbon 2012:18) "This would mean the household is more resilient in the face of the current crisis because of the transfer but not necessarily resilient to future, repeated crisis without the transfer. Ultimately the test of a good resilience building activity is one which reduces the caseload of beneficiaries in need of food or cash subsidies via any modality." (Fitzgibbon 2012:18) "Food for work programmes have been expanding in Kenya recently, particularly through the WFP Food for Assets programme (FFA) whereby communities are provided with food in exchange for their participation in works that strengthen their self-sufficiency and create assets that improve their food security." (Fitzgibbon 2012:18) "This has proven to stimulate markets with traders increasing incomes, turnover and trade in remote market locations. In addition, imported pulses in the food ration were substituted for vouchers for local food products (namely milk, meat and fish) purchased from local producers. This worked to provide a guaranteed local market for producers, many of whom were food aid beneficiaries throughout the drought period 34 ." (Fitzgibbon 2012:18) "Water emerges as the priority need for almost all drought affected communities. Although it does not represent the most significant humanitarian response cost, WASH interventions are the most frequent, widespread and regular." (Fitzgibbon 2012:18) "In total Government of Kenya provided nearly Ksh 1.2 billion (US\$14 million) in emergency water assistance which is twice that provided by the international community (US\$7.2m)." (Fitzgibbon 2012:19) "crude annual average cost of US\$1.87 per head. Clearly this cost only includes that recorded as emergency response and is divided by the entire population of the drought affected districts although only a small proportion benefited." (Fitzgibbon 2012:19) "When asked about the most useful and effective emergency response, beneficiaries regularly cite water tankering." (Fitzgibbon 2012:19) "WESCOORD members have agreed that emergency water tankering (i.e. paid for by GoK or agency humanitarian funds) should only be undertaken when human life is at risk. This is not always the case and many of the water tankering projects assessed in the 2009 assessment provided water for livestock. Very often livestock owners buy water for their herds raising the necessary resources from the sale of animals (see livestock section below). Livestock mortality is very often a factor of lack of water for herds." (Fitzgibbon 2012:19) "Quantifying the millions spent privately by families and pastoral producers on private water tankering to ensure their own and their herds survival is difficult." (Fitzgibbon 2012:20) "Given water is a perennial issue in ASAL areas, it regularly emerges as the primary concern when communities are facilitated to undertake risk and vulnerability assessments 37 . Consequently many NGOs have supported communities to develop appropriate, sustainable water sources, and build their capacity to manage and maintain them even through severe drought episodes." (Fitzgibbon 2012:20) "It is important to note that not all communities require emergency water tankering during drought periods. The majority of locations in the ASALs cope. These communities will usually have strategic water reserves in place e.g. dry season boreholes or reserve tanks." (Fitzgibbon 2012:20) "What all agencies supporting community water schemes stress is that establishing an effective WUA takes time and requires on-going support. It is considered impossible to establish a sustainable water user association within the timeframe of a humanitarian grant (12- 18 months maximum)." (Fitzgibbon 2012:20) xi really interesting - water resources would be really wanted and required by a minority of communities but overlaps in complex ways with private purchase of water eg for livestock. it is a long-term intervention cos you need to get community groups goingWhat all agencies supporting community water schemes stress is that establishing an effective WUA takes time and requires on-going support. It is considered impossible to establish a sustainable water user association within the timeframe of a humanitarian grant (12-18 months maximum). (note on p.20) "In discussions with NGOs 39 engaged in long term community water programmes it was considered reasonable to cost such projects over 10 years to ensure 'resilience'. Since water forms the foundation of all other community based DRR programming, this expenditure should also facilitate and support communities to undertake a range of complementary (and often low cost) activities." (Fitzgibbon 2012:21) "The Wider Costs and Benefits of Community Managed WASH programmes So are community managed water schemes a more cost effective approach? Some may argue that well managed and sustainable community water schemes function on a cost recovery basis and therefore should be generating sufficient income to cover operational costs long before 10 years." (Fitzgibbon 2012:21) "Anecdotally there is wide support for community managed and supported risk reduction programmes. Unfortunately there is limited cost data to undertake a more rigorous cost analysis." (Fitzgibbon 2012:22) " Animal Health - precisely the same interventions are proposed however vaccination campaigns undertaken before the drought has affected animals' body condition is far more effective than vaccination during a drought." (Fitzgibbon 2012:23) "Assessing the Wider Costs and Benefits - Livestock Reducing livestock mortality is essential given the sector represents such a high proportion of all damage and losses incurred 50 during drought periods. The livestock mortality experienced in recent droughts has resulted in increasing numbers of pastoral 'drop-outs' i.e. households that can no longer make ends meet from raising livestock alone. These households form the most chronically food insecure group increasingly reliant on food aid and cash safety nets for survival year round." (Fitzgibbon 2012:28) "The loss of milk from the pastoral diet during dry periods is thought to be one of the biggest factors affecting the chronically high child malnutrition rates in pastoral areas 5" (Fitzgibbon 2012:28) also a lot of stuff on livestock (note on p.28) "3.5.4 Other Interventions There is an endless array of interventions that can be undertaken in responding to humanitarian crisis and / or to build resilience. An indicative list is given below:  Expanding / Diversification of Livelihood activities" (Fitzgibbon 2012:29) " Expand basic and social services o Expanded coverage and completion of education" (Fitzgibbon 2012:30) " Expansion of wider scale infrastructure o Roads" (Fitzgibbon 2012:30) "Table 15: Example Costs and Benefits of Livelihood Diversification Schemes in ASALs of Kenya" (Fitzgibbon 2012:32) "Tana River Irrigation scheme (ICRC)" (Fitzgibbon 2012:32) " Scaling up Most projects work at the community level and few have more than 5,000 beneficiaries and many far fewer." (Fitzgibbon 2012:33) " Long term income levels The incomes reported from diversification projects vary widely. In fact it was extremely difficult to identify projects for this study that could readily supply any beneficiary income data. Several agencies admitted they had never done any income monitoring so just do not know." (Fitzgibbon 2012:33) " Support for sustainability There is broad agreement that the successful establishment of community based enterprises in very poor or marginal areas requires a certain level of support." (Fitzgibbon 2012:33) "If an ASAL-wide database of livelihood projects were created many of these issues could be monitored on a long term basis." (Fitzgibbon 2012:33) "There is much evidence to show that education, especially of girls, is a key factor in improving family and child health and nutrition indicators. In addition to its many intrinsic benefits, education is one of the most important livelihood diversification strategies." (Fitzgibbon 2012:34) "This gap in provision represents an inherent and natural bias in the provision of public investment in the most underserved areas. Education provision in semi-arid areas is much closer to the national average whereas the arid districts lag way behind." (Fitzgibbon 2012:36) "COST COMPARISON SCENARIOS FOR A TYPICAL KENYAN ASAL DISTRICT" (Fitzgibbon 2012:40) "The main report has attempted to quantify these costs for pastoral households using HEA analysis and the herd dynamic model developed by the Food Economy Group 66 ."

"Pastoralist and agropastoralists are also characterised by being wholly or semi-nomadic.

"National Expenditure on Resilience by International Donors Despite the high profile of drought emergencies in Kenya, even international donor funding is also inherently skewed towards non-ASAL areas. For example USAID is by far the largest humanitarian donor to Kenya providing over US\$231m to the drought crisis in 2011 (the majority of this was for food aid). It can be assumed the majority of this was directed to the ASAL areas (which also includes refugees in Kenyan camps). Although this represented 33\% of the total international response it still represents less than 20\% of total US funding to Kenya that focuses almost exclusively on the high potential areas."

"If the costs per beneficiary are doubled to crudely reflect a 12 month period they are actually almost exactly the same at \$54.83 as the current WFP food relief cost per person.

"Using Food and Cash Transfers to Build Resilience - The extent to which food and cash transfers alone ever truly build resilience, is a topic of heated debate.

\par
"This would mean the household is more resilient in the face of the current crisis because of the transfer but not necessarily resilient to future, repeated crisis without the transfer. Ultimately the test of a good resilience building activity is one which reduces the caseload of beneficiaries in need of food or cash subsidies via any modality."

"This has proven to stimulate markets with traders increasing incomes, turnover and trade in remote market locations.

Additionally, there was a curvilinear trend in the form of an inverted U, such that psychological benefits, most notably solidarity with others, were stronger at intermediate compared to high and low levels of exposure.

In Study 2, there were no significant differences in well-being between undergraduate students who said that something positive had come out of their worst stressor (n = 34) and those who reported no positives (n = 34). In Study 3, specific domains of SRG assessed in undergraduate students (n = 96) generally were not uniquely related to corresponding well-being measures. Thus, the authors found fairly little evidence for the validity of self-reported SRG. Future research directions are highlighted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2008 APA, all rights reserved)}

Assuming the invariance of error distributions may be essential for causal inference, but the errors themselves need not be invariant. Graphs can be interpreted using conditional distributions, so that we can better address connections between the mathematical framework and causality in the world. The identification problem is posed in terms of conditionals. As will be seen, causal relationships cannot be inferred from a data set by running regressions unless there is substantial prior knowledge about the mechanisms that generated the data. There are few successful applications of graphical models, mainly because few causal pathways can be excluded on a priori grounds. The invariance conditions themselves remain to be assessed.},

The objective of this article is to demonstrate a method for unlocking this paradox by making goal setting a process of evaluating goals, not simply defining them. Goals can be evaluated by asking program stakeholders why their goals are important to them. Systematic inquiry into goals also prepares the ground for setting consensual goals that express what stakeholders really care about. This article describes the method, provides a case illustration, offers guidelines for practice, and discusses the method in the context of the evaluation literature on goals and goal setting.},

The two tRNA genes are separated by a spacer segment highly homologous to a part of a unit which is repeated three times in the distal portion of the locus. This operon also contains coding capacity for a small basic protein. A genomic deletion of this locus was constructed and marked by a kanamycin resistance cassette. Deletion mutants exhibited a characteristic phenotype when cells were shifted from rich medium to minimal medium. The cells entered a transient lag phase, apparently resulting from specific glycine starvation. This phenotype involved stringent response and was therefore not observed in relA derivatives. The genomic deletion was complemented in trans by a plasmid-borne tyrT locus. From deletion mapping, it can be concluded that a product of the tyrT operon is responsible for complementation. However, neither the tRNA(1Tyr) nor the proposed basic protein is the complementation-competent entity.},

The purpose of the \{ITL\} project is to develop support for teacher-led innovation in a number of countries in the Balkans and elsewhere in Europe and to explore how this contributes to educational reform. Materials and techniques developed in the \{UK\} over many years are adapted and translated to enable partners in participating countries to support teachers as leaders of processes of innovation. Project team members in the participating countries have worked in collaboration with school principals and other facilitators to establish programmes that enable teachers to identify agendas and priorities for change, develop negotiated action plans and act strategically to embed innovations in their schools. Project team members have established the infrastructure of local knowledge networks through which teachers can come together to inspire each other and share accounts of their leadership of innovation. Vignettes and reports of teacher-led innovation have been captured and disseminated in order to build a body of knowledge about how to improve teaching and learning.}

Although the content of the business model has been extensively investigated from this perspective, less attention has been paid to the business model's causal structure - that is the pattern of cause-effect relations that, in top managers' or entrepreneurs' understandings, link value creation and value capture activities. Building on the strategic cognition literature, this paper argues that conceptualizing and analysing business models as cognitive maps can shed light on four important properties of a business model's causal structure: the levels of complexity, focus and clustering that characterize the causal structure and the mechanisms underlying the causal links featured in that structure. I use examples of business models drawn from the literature as illustrations to describe these four properties. Finally, I discuss the value of a cognitive mapping approach for augmenting extant theories and practices of business model design.},

  abstract = {Soon after 9 am on the 26th of December 2004, the district of Batticaloa on the eastern coast of Sri Lanka was struck by tidal waves produced by an earthquake off the coast of Sumatra. For the first two weeks after the tsunami struck, the concerns of humanitarian agencies, the Sri Lanka government, the militant Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), local and international emergency response teams, and the public in Batticaloa seemed to centre primarily on delivering material relief (food, clothing and shelter) and curative medical services to people displaced or otherwise affected by the tidal wave. There were, of course, significantly different perspectives about what were the most appropriate psychosocial interventions in the aftermath of the tsunami, and activities conducted in the Batticaloa district reflected this. This perspective prioritised addressing the social and material needs of affected persons as the primary form of support provision in the acute phase following the disaster. The variety of theoretical and practical approaches to psychosocial work both globally and in Sri Lanka presents a challenge for the development of an integrated psychosocial sector in Batticaloa. It may also be the extraordinary nature of the tsunami disaster that has inhibited a realisation that many of the difficulties faced by affected populations are similar to the losses and trials experienced during the extended years of conflict.

In the second part of the present article we provide some explanations for these differences. The reported higher vulnerability of women for PTSD could be due to the methodology used, the higher prevalence of childhood sexual abuse and rape in women, the different coping styles of women and men, or the more limited socio-economic resources of women.

Sixty-two disaster volunteers were randomly assigned to either a school-based (ERASE Stress) "training the trainers" course or to an alternative "befriending" program that served as a control group. Participants in the ERASE Stress course significantly improved their perception of self-efficacy as tsunami survivors' helpers (Disaster-Helper Self-Efficacy Scale), self-mastery (Mastery scale), and optimism about their personal future (item from the Children's Future Orientation Scale). In addition, the perceived ability to use cognitive coping strategies (Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire) such as refocusing on planning, positive reappraisal, and putting the trauma into perspective was enhanced. The ERASE Stress course may be an effective method for strengthening local community capacity to deal with trauma survivors in developing countries.

We first discuss the reasons why this relationship is not fully articulated in the current research. Rooted in a realist understanding of social emergence, we identify four possible strategies to bring social complexity back on focus when performing QCA: the use of thick case descriptions; the opening of the black box of conditions, by stacking and/or by developing them in a grounded manner; the integration of time in the method itself; and the combination of QCA with other, more time-sensitive methods.},

  abstract = {For much of the past two decades, expensive and often imported evidence-based programmes (EBPs) developed by clinician-researchers have been much in vogue in the family and parenting support field, as in many other areas of social provision. With their elaborate infrastructures, voluminous research bases and strict licensing criteria, they have seemed to offer certainty of success over less packaged, less well-evidenced locally developed approaches. Yet recently, evaluation research is showing that success is not assured. EBPs can and regularly do fail, at substantial cost to the public purse. In times of severe resource pressure, a pressing question is, therefore, whether lower cost, home-grown, practitioner-developed programmes-the sort often overlooked by policy-makers-can deliver socially significant and scientifically convincing outcomes at lower cost and at least on a par with their better resourced cousins. This paper shows how the application of techniques increasingly used in implementation science (the science of effective delivery) could help level the playing field. Processes for doing this including co-produced theory of change development and validation are illustrated with reference to the Family Links Ten Week Nurturing Programme (FLNP-10), a popular manualised group-based parenting support programme , designed and disseminated since the 1990s by a UK-based purveyor organisation. The paper draws out general principles for formulating and structuring strong theories of change for practice improvement projects. The work shows that novel application of implementation science-informed techniques can help home-grown programmes to compete scientifically by strengthening their design and delivery, and preparing the ground for better and fairer evaluation.},

Addressing this, we examine motivations to volunteer in a sample of 596 Indian college students. A majority of students volunteered. Three types of volunteering emerged: formal volunteering in non-profit agencies, informal volunteering outside these agencies, and hybrid volunteering consisting of volunteering informally in non-profit agencies. Structural and individual-level factors influenced volunteering. Altruism was associated with volunteering in all three sectors, but did not influence volunteering frequency. Parents, friends, and the internet were salient sources of information that encouraged volunteering. Two instrumental pathways of volunteering emerged: poor- and upper-class students volunteered to secure educational opportunities, while middle-class students volunteered to secure employment. Institutional opportunities to volunteer in religious settings and as mentors facilitated volunteering, while mandated volunteering in educational institutions, decreased engagement in it later.},

P. van Emmerik, et al (see record 2002-04271-001) which found that critical incident stress debriefing interventions do not improve natural recovery from psychological trauma. It is argued that the analysis is consistent with those of other researchers, indicating that debriefing (1) yielded no demonstrable effect on subsequent resolution of traumatic exposure and may inhibit or delay resolution for some participants; (2) showed a smaller effect than calculated for non-intervention controls, suggesting that natural proclivities toward resilience may be more potent than this style of intervention and (3) yielded lower effect-sizes than alternative interventions against which it was compared, raising the strong likelihood that other approaches are more likely to help. Although immediate debriefing has yielded null or paradoxical outcomes, the value of contemporaneous instrumental assistance and support has increasingly been found to be useful in disaster response. Structured interventions may be better embedded in models of stepped care, where the nature and level of intervention is conservatively tailored to the needs, context, and course of individual resolution.

  author = {Glouberman, Sholom and Zimmerman, Brenda},
  year = {2002},
  doi = {0-662-32778-0},
  abstract = {This paper begins by distinguishing simple, complicated and complex problems. In simple problems like cooking by following a recipe, the recipe is essential. It is often tested to assure easy replication without the need for any particular expertise. Recipes produce standardized products and the best recipes give good results every time. Complicated problems, like sending a rocket to the moon, are different. Formulae or recipes are critical and necessary to resolve them but are often not sufficient. High levels of expertise in a variety of fields are necessary for success. Sending one rocket increases assurance that the next mission will be a success. In some critical ways, rockets are similar to each other and because of this there can be a relatively high degree of certainty of outcome. Raising a child, on the other hand, is a complex problem. Here, formulae have a much more limited application. Raising one child provides experience but no assurance of success with the next. Although expertise can contribute to the process in valuable ways, it provides neither necessary nor sufficient conditions to assure success. To some extent this is because every child is unique and must be understood as an individual. As a result there is always some uncertainty of the outcome. The complexity of the process and the lack of certainty do not lead us to the conclusion that it is impossible to raise a child. In this paper we argue that health care systems are complex, and that repairing them is a complex problem. Most attempts to intervene in Medicare (and in many other health care systems) treat them as if they were merely complicated. We demonstrate this failure of understanding by tracing the deterioration of Medicare through a series of complicated interventions to its present destabilized state. We identify the tensions that seem to represent intractable problems in the Canadian and other systems that elicit strong responses from warring ideologies and professions. We argue that many of these dilemmas can be dissolved if the system is viewed as complex. We then present a detailed account of complex adaptive systems using health care examples to indicate the explanatory power of the approach. The first of four clusters of characteristics focuses on theory. Complex systems are non-linear and exhibit a great deal of noise, tension and fluctuation as they interact with the rest of the environment. The causality cluster identifies such characteristics as mutual causality, emergent outcomes and probabilistic, uncertain and somewhat non-predictable outcomes. The evidence cluster describes how evidence in such systems considers factors that are typically ignored in complicated systems such as outliers, historical anomalies, and the nature of actual as opposed to idealized relationships. The planning cluster identifies the notion of decision as emergent from processes rather than events. It stresses the need for deeper understanding of actual practices and argues that big changes can occur from small interventions in complex systems. The paper continues by applying this understanding of complex systems to two case studies. The first draws lessons from the 2000 World Health Organization Report that ranked the French health care system as first in the world. The French system resisted the massive dislocation and destabilization that affected many other countries in the developed world by steadfastly maintaining its basic values and instituting only small-scale changes. Despite widely prophesied financial ruin, the French system today costs the same 9.4 percent of GDP as the Canadian one. The second case considers Brazils successful response to the AIDS epidemic, which deals with vi seemingly intractable problems of underdevelopment by dissolving the dilemmas. A distinction is made between the complicated questions asked by the World Bank and the complex question asked by Brazil. The paper concludes with the application of a complex systems approach to some of the Canadian problems and identifies what successful reform would look like. Most critically, complicated questions would be transformed into complex ones. The complicated question What are the structures we need to make the health care system sustainable? becomes the complex question How do we build on current structures and relationships to stabilize and enhance Medicare? The question Can we afford increasing care and treatment for an aging population? is best understood as How can we provide care and treatment that makes everyone feel that the system will be there should their family need it? The question What do we have to give up to support the most effective and advanced technology (or drugs)? would better be asked as How can we help health care institutions and professionals enhance the quality of services and innovation in technology and drugs? and, finally, How much should Canadians pay for their health care? might become How can Medicare contribute even more to the Canadian identity? We then proceed to suggest ways in which these four questions might begin to be answered. We argue that we have been trapped into a narrow way of defining and responding to current issues as if they were merely complicated. Success in answering more complex questions will begin the process of revitalizing the Canadian health care system. It will help resolve many of the tensions, which are now present in the system. The struggle to answer even the few questions we have posed can improve how health care is provided by stabilizing the system, recognizing the nature of health care knowledge and providing opportunities to improve services in a cost contained environment. These are clearly not all the questions, nor are we capable of providing all the answers. But this new perspective can help refine the questions to ask and provide indications of some of the kinds of answers we need.},

It is often the case that concepts and measures agree on the extreme cases since they are clear-cut and easy to code, while at the same disagreeing frequently on cases in the middle.

Abstract BACKGROUND: In recent years the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) has been extensively used as a short screening instrument, producing results that are comparable to longer versions of the GHQ. METHODS: The validity of the GHQ-12 was compared with the GHQ-28 in a World Health organization study of psychological disorders in general health care. Results are presented for 5438 patients interviewed in 15 centres using the primary care version of the Composite International Diagnostic Instrument, or CIDI-PC. RESULTS: Results were uniformly good, with the average area under the ROC curve 88, range from 83 to 95. Minor variations in the criteria used for defining a case made little difference to the validity of the GHQ, and complex scoring methods offered no advantages over simpler ones. The GHQ was translated into 10 other languages for the purposes of this study, and validity coefficients were almost as high as in the original language. There was no tendency for the GHQ to work less efficiently in developing countries. Finally gender, age and educational level are shown to have no significant effect on the validity of the GHQ. CONCLUSIONS: If investigators wish to use a screening instrument as a case detector, the shorter GHQ is remarkably robust and works as well as the longer instrument. The latter should only be preferred if there is an interest in the scaled scores provided in addition to the total score.},

Scenarios are a common technique for investigating the future, but can be time consuming and challenging to develop, particularly when more than a single organisation is involved. An approach is presented here which shifts the focus of scenario building from the company level to the sector level, whereby a range of organisations engage collectively on a topic of mutual importance. A rapid technique was developed, with simple scenarios being constructed in 2-4. h. This process was implemented in 13 multi-organisational workshops with participants from the construction and building industries, sectors which are traditionally short-term and reactive in their outlook. The resulting feedback, observations and experiences are discussed, together with examples of how the resultant scenarios have been applied. An example of causal map reflection (exposing an individual's causal map to others) is also presented, described and critiqued. It was found that the process was successful in engaging participants in thinking about and discussing the future, appreciating the interconnectivities of the related issues, and understanding the collective implications of their potential decisions, as well as facilitating the socialisation of participant thinking and the construction of collective futures. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {To improve sustainability, farmers may want to redesign their livestock farming systems in depth. Systemic modelling has proved an efficient tool to study complex issues regarding farming systems, but it remains inefficient to support farmers in their system redesign processes. This paper describes and discusses a novel method to model livestock farming systems with groups of farmers to help them redesign their own systems. Modelling livestock farming systems at the farm scale with farmer groups is an original approach in livestock farming system modelling. Following a constructivist approach, our method involves working with farmers already involved in redesign processes and building causal maps according to their own representations, without using models previously created by scientists. Applying the method, we built two causal maps of livestock farming system operation, each one built with a group of five farmers including both those converting and converted to organic farming. Converting to organic farming was considered as one example of a redesign process. On the basis of a subjective assessment by both the participating farmers and researchers, and an analysis of map structures, we assessed the method's strengths and weaknesses. We considered that one of its main advantages lay in its collective dimension: sharing, comparing and questioning interested the participating farmers greatly; however, it requires good facilitation skills and suitable group composition. Furthermore, the formalising process identified, for example, vicious circles in system operation, which made the farmers think about solutions for breaking them. Finally, analysis of map structures identified similarities and differences between the two groups that were discussed with both of them during a final workshop; this activity continued farmers' self-reflection about their systems, which may help lead to innovative and more sustainable livestock farming systems.},

In contrast to the conventional wisdom that treats weighted voting rules as the primary means that powerful states use to codify their asymmetric control in institutional design, we propose that funding rules are equally important. Our framework develops a logic of substitution whereby permissive earmark rules\textemdash that allow donors to stipulate how their contributions to an IO are used\textemdash are a design substitute for weighted voting from wealthy states' perspective. Whether asymmetric control is incorporated in design through voting or funding rules depends on whether egalitarian norms emphasizing political and legal equality, or shareholder norms emphasizing influence commensurate with financial power, govern voting and representation rights at the IO. Focusing on the domain of climate finance, we demonstrate that weighted voting rules are used at international climate finance institutions (ICFIs) associated with multilateral development banks, but that wealthy states pursued permissive earmark rules at ICFIs within the United Nations system where egalitarian norms are strong. In this way, powerful donors can exert control over resource allocation even when developing states appear to hold equal influence on governing bodies. In addition to providing a reassessment of how power translates into control at IOs, our framework offers insight into forum-shopping behavior and sheds light on substitution dynamics that involve other dimensions of design across a range of issue areas.},

  abstract = {Background: Diabetes in pregnancy is common in South Asians, especially those from low-income backgrounds, and leads to short-term morbidity and longer-term metabolic programming in mother and offspring. We sought to understand the multiple influences on behaviour (hence risks to metabolic health) of South Asian mothers and their unborn child, theorise how these influences interact and build over time, and inform the design of culturally congruent, multi-level interventions. Methods: Our sample for this qualitative study was 45 women of Bangladeshi, Indian, Sri Lankan, or Pakistani origin aged 21-45 years with a history of diabetes in pregnancy, recruited from diabetes and antenatal services in two deprived London boroughs. Overall, 17 women shared their experiences of diabetes, pregnancy, and health services in group discussions and 28 women gave individual narrative interviews, facilitated by multilingual researchers, audiotaped, translated, and transcribed. Data were analysed using the constant comparative method, drawing on sociological and narrative theories. Results: Key storylines (over-arching narratives) recurred across all ethnic groups studied. Short-term storylines depicted the experience of diabetic pregnancy as stressful, difficult to control, and associated with negative symptoms, especially tiredness. Taking exercise and restricting diet often worsened these symptoms and conflicted with advice from relatives and peers. Many women believed that exercise in pregnancy would damage the fetus and drain the mother's strength, and that eating would be strength-giving for mother and fetus. These short-term storylines were nested within medium-term storylines about family life, especially the cultural, practical, and material constraints of the traditional South Asian wife and mother role and past experiences of illness and healthcare, and within longer-term storylines about genetic, cultural, and material heritage - including migration, acculturation, and family memories of food insecurity. While peer advice was familiar, meaningful, and morally resonant, health education advice from clinicians was usually unfamiliar and devoid of cultural meaning. Conclusions: 'Behaviour change' interventions aimed at preventing and managing diabetes in South Asian women before and during pregnancy are likely to be ineffective if delivered in a socio-cultural vacuum. Individual education should be supplemented with community-level interventions to address the socio-material constraints and cultural frames within which behavioural 'choices' are made.},

This investigative qualitative study of International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent staff was conducted in three West African countries to assess the current staff health situation and make recommendations for improvement to issues and needs that may impact staff capacity to deliver services during deployment.

The information will be used to inform a modified Delphi study for the development of minimum standards for occupational health for humanitarian aid workers. A total of 24 delegates were interviewed in Conakry (Guinea), Freetown and Kenema (Sierra Leone) and Monrovia (Liberia). The issues raised during the interviews covered pre-deployment, deployment, post-deployment and various issues related to work and life as a delegate in an Ebola operation. Pre-deployment issues raised were: addressing the concerns expressed by family, friends and employer, the importance of medical clearance and receiving health briefing prior to deployment and appropriate special training. Deployment raised different issues regarding ability to maintain personal health, location and acceptability of accommodation, new ways of living and working, including development of standard operating procedures to ensure quality of care and safety, security and travel restrictions and communication with family, friends and colleagues. Post-deployment concerns included media-related issues impacting on family, alienation instead of admiration, quarantine and ability to go home, and coming to terms with their experiences. The Ebola outbreak posed a huge challenge to the deploying humanitarian organisations in terms of recruiting, preparing, deploying, post-deployment and supporting their delegates through this process. The lessons learnt from this study and recommendations made to improve the future health and safety of humanitarian aid workers will inform the development of minimum standards for occupational health for these professions.},

Key Practitioner Message * Research attests to high levels of symptoms among post-war civil populations, in particular, when a loved one was killed, which can lead not only to trauma reactions but also to severe separation distress. * Grieving the loss of a loved one is hampered if the death remains unconfirmed. * Unconfirmed loss could be conceptualized as unfinished business in terms of Gestalt therapy, which offers empty-chair dialogue for resolving unfinished business and grief. * Dialogical exposure therapy (DET) supports the client in gaining awareness of and expressing his or her inner dialogues concerning the traumatic event, using Gestalt empty-chair method. * Short-term DET was effective in treating traumatically bereaved women but showed little additional effects in comparison with a supportive group treatment, so further research is warranted.},

  abstract = {Extreme events are one of the main channels through which climate and socioeconomic systems interact, and it is likely that climate change will modify the probability distribution of the losses they generate. The long-term growth models used in climate change assessments, however, cannot capture the effects of such short-term shocks. To investigate this issue, a non-equilibrium dynamic model (NEDyM) is used to assess the macroeconomic consequences of extreme events. This exercise allowed us to define the economic amplification ratio, as the ratio of the overall production loss due to an event to its direct costs. This ratio could be used to improve the cost\textendash benefit analysis of prevention measures. We found also that, unlike a Solow-like model, NEDyM exhibits a bifurcation in GDP losses: for each value of the capacity to fund reconstruction, GDP losses remain moderate if the intensity and frequency of extremes remain under a threshold value, beyond which GDP losses increase sharply. This bifurcation may partly explain why some poor countries that experience repeated natural disasters cannot develop. Applied to the specific issue of climate change, this model highlights the importance of short-term constraints in the assessment of long-term damages, and shows that changes in the distribution of extremes may entail significant GDP losses in absence of specific adaptation. It suggests, therefore, that to avoid inaccurately low assessments of damages, researchers must take into account the distribution of extremes instead of their average cost and make explicit assumptions on the organization of future economies.},

Most theory-based approaches are program theory driven and some are stakeholder oriented as well. Practically, all of the latter fuse the program perceptions of the various stakeholder groups into one unitary program theory. The TSE model keeps the program theories of the diverse stakeholder groups apart from each other and from the program theory embedded in the institutionalized intervention itself. This represents, the authors argue, an important clarification and extension of the standard theory-based evaluation. The TSE model is elaborated to enhance theory-based evaluation of interventions characterized by conflicts and competing program theories. The authors argue that especially in evaluations of complex and complicated multilevel and multisite interventions, the presence of competing theories is likely and the TSE model may prove useful.},

To effectively implement such treatments, accurate and reliable PTSD screening instruments are needed. Unfortunately, no standardized PTSD measure has been validated among women substance abusers. Therefore, the goal of this investigation was to examine the psychometric utility of two PTSD measures to optimize the number of women clients correctly identified as meeting diagnostic criterion for PTSD. Forty-four women in residential substance use treatment were administered diagnostic interviews for PTSD (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale) and then completed questionnaires regarding trauma exposure and related symptoms. In this group, 38.6\% of the participants met diagnostic criteria for current PTSD. A score of 38 and above on the PTSD Checklist Civilian Version and a Penn Inventory score of 25 and above optimally maximized the number of women with PTSD identified and minimized false negative and false positive rates.

Through direct participation, children can develop a genuine appreciation of democracy and a sense of their own competence and responsibility. The planning, design, monitoring and management of the physical environment is an ideal domain for their participation, in part because their commitment to it is so strong. The book is for planners, educationalists and environmentalists, introducing the theory and the practice of children's participation, and its importance for developing democracy and sustainable communities. It emphasises genuine participation, where children are themselves involved in defining problems and acting as reflective, critical participants in issues affecting their communities. The 'environment' is interpreted broadly to include, for example, the planning of housing areas and the management of playgrounds. Detailed case studies are provided from urban and rural, poor and middle class communities from both the North and South. For teachers, group facilitators and community leaders, it presents organising principles, successful models, practical techniques and resources for involving young people in environmental projects.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The traumatic events experienced in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the 1992-1995 conflict may have a lasting effect on the mental health of the citizens, characterized by high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. A diagnosis of PTSD, depression, and anxiety among family physician residents could affect their ability to diagnose and treat patients for depression, anxiety and PTSD. OBJECTIVES: To assess PTSD, depression and anxiety symptoms and prevalence amongst family medicine residents (FMR) who were general practitioners (GP) in different war engagements and compare them with FMR who were medical students, 9 years after the 1992-1995 war in Bosnia-Herzegovina (BH). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We applied the Bosnia-Herzegovina versions of both the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ) for PTSD symptoms, and Hopkins Symptom Checklist - 25 (HSCL-25) for anxiety and depression symptoms to 78 residents (age 30-45 years, 84.6\% females), who lived in BH during the conflict years. RESULTS: PTSD prevalence of 10.3\% and depression and anxiety prevalence of 21.8\%, was found. The anxiety symptoms score was significantly higher amongst FMR who were GPs (1.69+/-0.66) than medical students (1.40+/-0.41, t-test=2.219, P=0.029) during the war.},

Using a qualitative grounded theory approach, we examine the different types of social capital (bonding, bridging, and linking) through a social work lens. We examine how social capital operated in the lives of 40 families following Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, Louisiana. We attempt to understand how residents utilized their social capital to survive the storm, relocate, and rebuild their lives and communities. Results indicate residents, especially those with low incomes, relied on, built upon, and collapsed all levels of social capital for individual, family, and community survival. Participants described a process through which close ties (bonding) were important for immediate support, but bridging and linking social capital offered pathways to longer term survival and wider neighborhood and community revitalization. This paper also discusses how social capital inclusion in social work can strengthen or hinder individual and community development following a catastrophic event.},

  abstract = {Participatory systems thinking methods are often used in community-based participatory research to engage and respond to complexity. Participation in systems thinking activities creates opportunities for participants to gain useful insights about complexity. It is desirable to design activities that extend the benefits of this participation into communities, as these insights are predictive of success in community-based prevention. This study tests an online, computer-mediated participatory system modelling platform (STICKE) and associated methods for collating and analysing its outputs. STICKE was trialled among a group of community members to test a computer-mediated system modelling exercise. The causal diagrams resulting from the exercise were then merged, and network analysis and DEMATEL methods applied to inform the generation of a smaller summary model to communicate insights from the participant group as a whole. Participants successfully completed the online modelling activity, and created causal diagrams consistent with expectations. The DEMATEL analysis was identified as the participant-preferred method for converging individuals causal diagrams into a coherent and useful summary. STICKE is an accessible tool that enabled participants to create causal diagrams online. Methods trialled in this study provide a protocol for combining and summarising individual causal diagrams that was perceived to be useful by the participant group. STICKE supports communities to consider and respond to complex problems at a local level, which is cornerstone of sustainable effective prevention. Understanding how communities perceive their own health challenges will be important to better support and inform locally owned prevention efforts.},

The user adds factors and connections in any desired order. STICKE provides a function which automates the process of untangling the connection circle into a more conventional causal diagram. The untangling process is led by a modified force-layout algorithm that analyses model structure and reconfigures the map based on the objectives of minimising crossover of connection arrows, and emphasising feedback loops.

  abstract = {Interest in the phenomenon of perceived growth following highly stressful experiences continues to proliferate. Already there is abundant evidence that perceptions of growth are commonly reported, often by the majority of people experiencing even the most traumatic of events. However, much remains to be learned about perceptions of growth. In this article, the authors pose 7 major theoretical and empirical questions regarding perceived growth, including issues of measurement, validity, mechanisms, links with well-being, and clinical implications. The authors summarize the current status of psychologists' knowledge, including articles in the present special section, and conclude that there is much to learn about perceived growth. The authors end with suggestions for future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2008 APA, all rights reserved)}

  abstract = {Articles Articles should deal wth topics applicable to the broad field of program evaluation. Articles may focus on evaluation methods, theory, practice, or findings. In all cases, implications for practicing evaluators should be clearly identified. Examples of contributions include, but are not limited to, reviews of new developments in evaluation, descriptions of a current evaluation study, critical reviews of some area of evaluation practice, and presentations of important new techniques. Manuscripts should follow APA format for references and style. Most submissions are 20\textendash 30 double-spaced typewritten pages in length; longer articles will also be published if their importance to AJE readers age is judged to be high. ABSTRACT Although use is a core construct in the field of evaluation, neither the change processes through which evaluation affects attitudes, beliefs, and actions, nor the interim outcomes that lie between the evaluation and its ultimate goal\textemdash social betterment\textemdash have been sufficiently developed. We draw a number of these change mechanisms, such as justification, persuasion, and policy diffu-sion, from the social science research literature, and organize them into a framework that has three levels: individual, interpersonal, and collective. We illustrate how these change processes can be linked together to form " pathways " or working hypotheses that link evaluation processes to outcomes that move us along the road toward the goal of social betterment. In addition, we join with Kirkhart (2000) in moving beyond use, to focus our thinking on evaluation influence. Influence, combined with the set of mechanisms and interim outcomes presented here, offers a better way for thinking about, communicating, and adding to the evidence base about the consequences of evaluation and the relationship of evaluation to social betterment.},

The results generated by the crowdsourced participants were compared to results generated by experts. We found that crowdsourcing to develop code and textual responses was feasible, rapid, and inexpensive, offering the potential to enhance patient stakeholder engagement in evaluation.

Building on that research, the authors applied Integrative Proposition Analysis to visualize, integrate, and assess the quality and usefulness of knowledge gained from the NMAC (formerly National Minority AIDS Council) Strong Communities evaluation. Purpose: Demonstrate an innovative method to rigorously integrate and strengthen knowledge gained from evaluation and to encourage discussion of future directions for developing stronger theories for more effective evaluation and more effective action. Setting: Birmingham, Alabama. Intervention: A project to identify local strategies for community-based organizations and community health centers that serve African American and Latinx gay and bisexual men and transgender women to collaboratively meet HIV-related community needs. Research Design: The researchers applied Integrative Propositional Analysis to integrate and map concepts and causal connections emerging from the evaluation findings. The authors then analyzed the resulting map to identify topmentioned concepts, better understood concepts, reinforcing loops, and knowledge gaps. Data Collection and Analysis: Integrative Propositional Analysis applied to a literature review and stakeholder interview transcripts collected for the evaluation. Findings: Integrating literature and interview results helped to identify several actions where providers of HIV-related services could increase their impact on combating the HIV epidemic among the communities they serve. The authors also identified a reinforcing loop; this shows opportunity to improve two desired outcomes by increasing one. In addition, the authors identified blank spots on the map; these show where additional research could strengthen the quality and usefulness of the mapped knowledge.},

  abstract = {Complexity heightens the importance of effective management, but poses challenges for the tools and approaches used most widely in international development. This guide provides an overview of these challenges and proposes a way forward: ? Management tools need to be chosen to match the situation in hand, based on whether capacities are distributed, goals are divergent, and whether there is considerable uncertainty. ? Managing in the face of complexity should be guided by three key principles: decentralised, collaborative and adaptive management. ? A selection of appropriate approaches illustrates how these principles can be applied in practice. At the end, the guide provides readers with further resources on the subject.},

"hough a logframe can be utilised initially as a tentative project plan, logframes are rarely revised even when the situation has changed. By the end of the project, the original logframe may not be an accurate embodiment of what the project is about and therefore logframes do not particularly help in terminal or ex-post evaluations. Still, having been institutionalized by clients, logframe-based evaluations are common practice and in extreme cases, evaluators face the danger of evaluating the logframe instead of the actual project. Although widely used for its simplicity, logframes can end up becoming a cumbersome tool, or even a hindrance to evaluatio" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_75E75W6I/4}{Hummelbrunner 2010:4})

The framework-Bayesian integration of quantitative and qualitative data (BIQQ)-allows researchers to draw causal inferences from combinations of correlational (cross-case) and process-level (within-case) observations, given prior beliefs about causal effects, assignment propensities, and the informativeness of different kinds of causal-process evidence. In addition to posterior estimates of causal effects, the framework yields updating on the analytical assumptions underlying correlational analysis and process tracing. We illustrate the BIQQ approach with two applications to substantive issues that have received significant quantitative and qualitative treatment in political science: the origins of electoral systems and the causes of civil war. Finally, we demonstrate how the framework can yield guidance on multimethod research design, presenting results on the optimal combinations of qualitative and quantitative data collection under different research conditions.},

The CGHQ, which takes account of the chronicity of psychiatric symptoms, is found to be superior to the conventional scoring method in yielding a wider range of scores, a more normal distribution and in its close association to a well validated measure of neurotic illness. On the other hand, the conventional GHQ and the CGHQ score appear equally sensitive to a number of socio-demographic variables, including social class, marital status and employment. An important finding is that the two methods identify different individuals as cases. Compared with the GHQ, the CGHQ identifies a higher proportion of the middle-aged. The implications of these findings with respect to the optimal method of scoring the GHQ are discussed.},

  abstract = {The development of robotic devices for rehabilitation is a fast-growing field. Nowadays, thanks to novel technologies that have improved robots' capabilities and offered more cost-effective solutions, robotic devices are increasingly being employed during clinical practice, with the goal of boosting patients' recovery. Robotic rehabilitation is also widely used in the context of neurological disorders, where it is often provided in a variety of different fashions, depending on the specific function to be restored. Indeed, the effect of robot-aided neurorehabilitation can be maximized when used in combination with a proper training regimen (based on motor control paradigms) or with non-invasive brain machine interfaces. Therapy-induced changes in neural activity and behavioral performance, which may suggest underlying changes in neural plasticity, can be quantified by multimodal assessments of both sensorimotor performance and brain/muscular activity pre/post or during intervention. Here, we provide an overview of the most common robotic devices for upper and lower limb rehabilitation and we describe the aforementioned neurorehabilitation scenarios. We also review assessment techniques for the evaluation of robotic therapy. Additional exploitation of these research areas will highlight the crucial contribution of rehabilitation robotics for promoting recovery and answering questions about reorganization of brain functions in response to disease.},

"Purpose of the meeting" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_JQ3ZIFS4/2}{IFRC 2013:2})
\par
"To inform technical leads in OD and Health at the IFRC Geneva level and in targeted Zones about the opportunities to scale up CHWs." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_JQ3ZIFS4/2}{IFRC 2013:2})
\par
"To discuss an agenda of pertinent health and OD related technical issues which will drive our internal decision making processes in scaling up community health and CHW structures" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_JQ3ZIFS4/2}{IFRC 2013:2})
\par
"CHW and Red Cross/Red Crescent  - why now? \textbullet{} The Millennium Development Goals for Health (4-6) will not be reached in many countries of the world, (reduce child mortality, improve maternal health, combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases) and there will be a continuous push to keep these goals relevant through a post-MDG agenda" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_JQ3ZIFS4/3}{IFRC 2013:3})
\par
"Community health interventions are not a technical problem - we know what works in terms of low cost primary care interventions. (See MDG results updates) \textbullet{} It is delivery and resource issue." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_JQ3ZIFS4/3}{IFRC 2013:3})
\par
"\textbullet{} Can Red Cross which has successfully built volunteer driven health delivery systems based on its CBHFA approach (92 NS use CBHFA), help scale-up community structures relying on CHWs and health volunteers as a more comprehensive/hybridmodel?" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_JQ3ZIFS4/3}{IFRC 2013:3})
\par
"There are two major barriers: 1. Not enough investments in health system strengthening 2. Massive shortages of trained human resources for health (HRH) most notably doctors, nurses, midwifes." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_JQ3ZIFS4/4}{IFRC 2013:4})
\par
"In Africa, 3\% of the world's health workers combat 24\% of the global disease burden with less than 1\% of the global health expenditures. (WHO)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_JQ3ZIFS4/4}{IFRC 2013:4})
\par
"\textbullet{} The correct treatment of childhood pneumonia, diarrhea and malaria is one of the most powerful interventions to reduce mortality. If child mortality is to be adequately addressed, the challenge of access must be taken on. \textbullet{} Community health workers - appropriately trained, supervised and supported with an uninterrupted supply of medicines and equipment   can identify and correctly treat most children who have the conditions mentioned above." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_JQ3ZIFS4/5}{IFRC 2013:5})
\par
"\textbullet{} Major technical agencies have been contacting us to discuss the role of the Red Cross in an emerging attempt to build momentum on a global level for more technical and financial support to scale up CHW driven community health service delivery. \textbullet{} A lot of this momentum is being generated because the traditional service delivery models which are quite vertical in nature are not effective enough to reach the Health MDGs and other established targets. CHW assisted programs such as iCCM are seen as a major solution." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_JQ3ZIFS4/6}{IFRC 2013:6})
\par
"Progress so far \textbullet{} May 2013: ARC meeting with Columbia University Earth Institute where Red Cross was first asked to play a more prominent role in scaling up CHWs" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_JQ3ZIFS4/7}{IFRC 2013:7})

"August/September: First Feasibility Study is written in Haiti, which is seeking to scale up CHWs as an MoH priority." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_JQ3ZIFS4/7}{IFRC 2013:7})
\par
"\textbullet{} How does any support to a larger CHW initiative fit into the emerging resilience agenda?" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_JQ3ZIFS4/8}{IFRC 2013:8})
\par
"\textbullet{} How does our current CBHFA approach benefit or hinder  a future engagement? Are we indeed "60 \%" there already with our current programming which has not necessarily been seen as critical to achieving larger health targets (MDGs and others)?" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_JQ3ZIFS4/8}{IFRC 2013:8})
\par
"\textbullet{} On the other hand some vertical disease control work (Measles or Malaria) has been well recognized. Can we do campaigns but not routine service delivery - is that a capacity/OD /partnership issue?" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_JQ3ZIFS4/8}{IFRC 2013:8})
\par
"\textbullet{} Volunteerism versus paid services? Given our capacity to recruit and train community volunteers, are we willing to train them and loose them to paid jobs? Is economic empowerment through job creation part of our resilience building vision and does it start with our best and able volunteers?" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_JQ3ZIFS4/9}{IFRC 2013:9})
\par
"\textbullet{} Can we provide 10\% of our volunteers to overcome 50\% of the current CHW gap according to WHO until 2016?" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_JQ3ZIFS4/10}{IFRC 2013:10})

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The 2014 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak was characterised by fear, misconceptions and irrational behaviours. We conducted a knowledge attitude and practice survey of EVD in Nigeria to inform implementation of effective control measures.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nMETHODS: Between July 30th and September 30th 2014, we undertook a cross sectional study on knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) among adults of the general population and healthcare workers (HCW) in three states of Nigeria, namely Bayelsa, Cross River and Kano states. Demographic information and data on KAP were obtained using a self-administered standardized questionnaire. The percentage KAP scores were categorised as good and poor. Independent predictors of good knowledge of EVD were ascertained using a binary logistic regression model.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nRESULTS: Out of 1035 study participants with median age of 32 years, 648 (62.6\%) were males, 846 (81.7\%) had tertiary education and 441 (42.6\%) were HCW. There were 218, 239 and 578 respondents from Bayelsa, Cross River and Kano states respectively. The overall median percentage KAP scores and interquartile ranges (IQR) were 79.46\% (15.07\%), 95.0\% (33.33\%) and 49.95\% (37.50\%) respectively. Out of the 1035 respondents, 470 (45.4\%), 544(52.56\%) and 252 (24.35\%) had good KAP of EVD defined using 80\%, 90\% and 70\% score cut-offs respectively. Independent predictors of good knowledge of EVD were being a HCW (Odds Ratio-OR-2.89, 95\% Confidence interval-CI of 1.41-5.90), reporting 'moderate to high fear of EVD' (OR-2.15, 95\% CI-(1.47-3.13) and 'willingness to modify habit' (OR-1.68, 95\% CI-1.23-2.30).\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nCONCLUSION: Our results reveal suboptimal EVD-related knowledge, attitude and practice among adults in Nigeria. To effectively control future outbreaks of EVD in Nigeria, there is a need to implement public sensitization programmes that improve understanding of EVD and address EVD-related myths and misconceptions, especially among the general population.},

I then discuss the relative merits of these approaches for empirical work in economics, focusing on the questions each answer well, and why much of the the work in economics is closer in spirit to the potential outcome framework.},

In the last two decades, much research has been done on the econometric and statistical analysis of such causal effects. This recent theoretical literature has built on, and combined features of, earlier work in both the statistics and econometrics literatures. It has by now reached a level of maturity that makes it an important tool in many areas of empirical research in economics, including labor economics, public finance, development economics, industrial organization, and other areas of empirical microeconomics. In this review, we discuss some of the recent developments. We focus primarily on practical issues for empirical researchers, as well as provide a historical overview of the area and give references to more technical research.},

Hundreds had to be evacuated. The Costa Rican Red Cross deployed 120 people in the search and rescue operation, which was made extremely dangerous because of constant, ongoing landslides in the zone affected. Following the disaster, the International Federation, supported by the Regional Delegation in Central America, obtained funding from the British government to implement an early warning system in the event of future landslides.

  abstract = {The aim of the paper is to critically review the notion of social capital and review empirical literature on the association between social capital and health across countries. The methodology used for the review includes a systematic search on electronic databases for peer-reviewed published literature. We categorize studies according to level of analysis (single and multilevel) and examine whether studies reveal a significant health impact of individual and area level social capital. We compare the study conclusions according to the country's degrees of economic egalitarianism. Regardless of study design, our findings indicate that a positive association (fixed effect) exists between social capital and better health irrespective of countries degree of egalitarianism. However, we find that the between-area variance (random effect) in health tends to be lower in more egalitarian countries than in less egalitarian countries. Our tentative conclusion is that an association between social capital and health at the individual level is robust with respect to the degree of egalitarianism within a country. Area level or contextual social capital may be less salient in egalitarian countries in explaining health differences across places.},

This method appears to be especially well suited for the type of text generated by open-ended questions as well for organizational research questions that are exploratory in nature, aimed at scale or interview question development, and/or developing conceptual coding schemes. A detailed example of concept mapping on open-ended survey data is presented. Reliability and validity-issues associated with concept mapping are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Recent evaluations have begun to use qualitative data in a manner that helps improve the quality and relevance of studies through the inferences that are drawn from them, and their applicability to policy makers and programme implementers. This paper reviews this work and identifies good practices to integrate qualitative methods into quantitative impact evaluations (IEs) and systematic reviews (SRs). Using recent literature on the characteristics of such practices, we developed two tools to assess the methodological rigour and mixed methods integration of 40 IEs and 7 SRs, drawing upon previous approaches. Our findings are that successful mixed methods quantitative impact evaluations: (1) provide a clear rationale for integration of methods; (2) deploy multidisciplinary teams; (3) provide adequate documentation; and (4) acknowledge limitations to the generalisability of qualitative and quantitative findings. Successful integration tended to improve mixed methods impact evaluations by collecting better data to inform the study design and findings, which helped contextualise quantitative findings. Our main observation on the integration of mixed methods in the systematic reviews is that mixed methods systematic reviews bringing together literatures that answer different questions can go beyond the `sum of their parts' to provide holistic answers about development effectiveness. The findings of this study inform several recommendations to improve the conduct and reporting of mixed methods impact evaluations and systematic reviews.},

This alloy system exhibited good thermal stability with high glass transition temperature (T-g) 860 K and crystallization temperature (T-x) 945 K. The addition of Co was found to be effective in adjusting the alloy composition deeper to eutectic, leading to lower liquidus temperature (T-l). The [(Fe0.8Co0.2)(72)Mo4B24](94)Dy-6 alloy showed the largest supercooled liquid region (Delta T-x = T-x - T-g = 92 K), reduced glass transition temperature (T-rg = T-g/T-l = 0.622) and gamma parameter (gamma = T-x/(T-g + T-l) = 0.424) among the present system. Maximum compressive fracture strength of 3540 MPa and micro-Vickers hardness of 1185 kg/mm(2) was achieved, resulting from the strong bonding structure among the alloy constituents. The alloy system possessed soft magnetic properties with high saturation magnetization of 56.61-61.78 Am-2/kg and coercivity in the range of 222-264.2 A/m, which might be suitable for application in power electronics devices.

  abstract = {Objectives. Many people flee their countries of origin after suffering severe trauma and there is a need to explore how socio-cultural factors are implicated in the experience of both trauma and posttraumatic growth. Interpreters who have been through a trauma are in a unique position to be able to reflect on cultural context. This study explored how interpreters working in the UK who had formerly suffered trauma in their country of origin, and who identified themselves as coping well, managed their experience of trauma. Design. The qualitative method Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) was used. Nine interpreters were interviewed following a semi-structured guide and the resulting transcripts were analysed according to IPA principles. Results. Three key themes emerged from the data that were labelled as: trauma in the context of wider shared oppression; resisting and responding; and cultural protection and growth. Many participants described their lives prior to arriving in the UK as involving a collective traumatisation as a result of being a victim of oppression related to their cultural identity. The participants described the importance of staying connected to their culture. Giving and providing social support, religious practices, and the role of interpreter facilitated remaining connected. Conclusions. A sense of shared victimisation provided a protective backdrop from which the participants could make sense of the personal traumas they had experienced. The role of interpreting was important as it helped maintain cultural identity. The findings are discussed in relation to theories of both PTSD and Posttraumatic Growth. The results have implications for the work of clinicians supporting non-Western people who have been traumatised.}

Prevalence rates are reviewed and predictors are discussed in terms of risk factors, protective factors, and factors that maintain PTSD. Most epidemiologically sound studies found relatively low rates of PTSD. There is good evidence of a dose-response relationship between cumulative war trauma and torture and development and maintenance of PTSD. There is also some evidence that female gender and older age are risk factors in development of PTSD. Some refugee variables may exacerbate symptoms of PTSD and contribute to their maintenance. Preparedness for torture, social and family support, and religious beliefs may all be protective against PTSD following war trauma and torture. Applicability of the concept of PTSD to non-western populations and areas for much needed further study are discussed. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6VB8-4N3WYR6-1/2/c04c8cb431a792fb1517ebd2aa9cfae2}

  abstract = {Empirical evidence from various social and educational contexts suggests that private tutoring (\{PT\}) services are more accessible to pupils from families of more advantaged socio-economic status. This, in turn, reflects and/or exacerbates both social and educational inequalities, an outcome that has been shown through previous research in Croatia and Bosnia \$\textbackslash backslash\$\& Herzegovina. The present chapter explores educational stakeholders' perspectives on the differences in patterns of \{PT\} use by pupils from different socio-economic backgrounds. Secondly, it explores the relevance educational stakeholders assign to the issue of social equity related to \{PT\} and their willingness and capacity to address this issue. Data were collected using individual semi-structured interviews and focus groups with selected educational stakeholders. Criterion and purposive sampling were used to identify educational stakeholders from governmental, political, professional, parental, educational, media and academic spheres. The findings indicate that, in both countries, social equity issues associated with \{PT\} are mainly related to differences in the quality, frequency, continuity and purpose of \{PT\} services. Issues of social equity, as they relate to \{PT\}, emerged as a marginal concern. In addition, the findings from both countries indicate a lack of readiness and ability amongst educational stakeholders to adequately deal with and address issues of social equity. The findings also revealed a substantial homogeneity of perspectives between and within the two countries.},

This paper presents an overview of research using the IES in an attempt to assess its psychometric status. It is concluded that the psychometric properties of the IES are satisfactory (although not as a PTSD diagnostic measure) and that continued use of the IES as a measure of intrusive and avoidant processes is warranted.}

(2527)Estimating the Multilevel Rasch Model: With the lme4 Package
\par
Reference: ~~~~Vol. 20, Issue 2, Feb 2007

Abstract:
\par
Traditional Rasch estimation of the item and student parameters via marginal maximum likelihood, joint maximum likelihood or conditional maximum likelihood, assume individuals in clustered settings are uncorrelated and items within a test that share a grouping structure are also uncorrelated. These assumptions are often violated, particularly in educational testing situations, in which students are grouped into classrooms and many test items share a common grouping structure, such as a content strand or a reading passage. Consequently, one possible approach is to explicitly recognize the clustered nature of the data and directly incorporate random effects to account for the various dependencies. This article demonstrates how the multilevel Rasch model can be estimated using the functions in R for mixed-effects models with crossed or partially crossed random effects. We demonstrate how to model the following hierarchical data structures: a) individuals clustered in similar settings (e.g., classrooms, schools), b) items nested within a particular group (such as a content strand or a reading passage), and c) how to estimate a teacher x content strand interaction.}

Career success was argued to be comprised of intrinsic success (job satisfaction) and extrinsic success (income and occupational status) dimensions. Data were obtained from the Intergenerational Studies, a set of 3 studies that followed participants from early childhood to retirement. The most general findings were that conscientiousness positively predicted intrinsic and extrinsic career success, neuroticism negatively predicted extrinsic success, and general mental ability positively predicted extrinsic career success. Personality was related to career success controlling for general mental ability and, though adulthood measures of the Big Five traits were more strongly related to career success than were childhood measures, both contributed unique variance in explaining career success.}

Norms are assumed to be constructed ad hoc by recruiting specific representations. Category norms are derived by recruiting exemplars.

The normality of a stimulus is evaluated by comparing it with the norms that it evokes after the fact, rather than to precomputed expectations. Norm theory is applied in analyses of the enhanced emotional response to events that have abnormal causes, of the generation of predictions and inferences from observations of behavior, and of the role of norms in causal questions and answers.

Kalayjian, as the MHOP Director, uses a Six-Step Bio-Psychosocial and Spiritual model comprised of six steps when treating individuals and families after a disaster. The following are the six-steps: (1) levels of distress are assessed utilizing the revised Reaction Index Scale (RIS/R), (2) discovery of memories \& expression of feelings are encouraged to help survivors discuss the sequence of events in a manner free of anger and blame, (3) provide empathy and validation for survivors who are normally full of guilt, fear, and sadness, (4) encourage discovery and expression of positive meaning, (5) provide didactic information sensitive to their developmental stage and crucial to their healing since may blame themselves, and (6) provide instructions for diaphragmatic breathing and physical relief to normalize respiratory patterns (Kalayjian, 2002).

  abstract = {Different neuroimaging techniques provided evidence for structural and functional brain alterations in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Due to technical improvements, especially concerning localization techniques and more reliable analysis methods, one technique, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), has increasingly become of interest because it allows further insight into metabolic mechanisms that may contribute to these alterations. The aim of this article is, therefore, to review recent studies utilizing 1H-MRS of the hippocampus and other brain structures in PTSD. Using meta-analytic methods, we attempted to answer the question if PTSD, as compared to different types of control samples, is accompanied by altered neurometabolite ratios and concentrations in the tissue of different brain regions. A second intent was to review methodological aspects to advise on a minimal standard for reliable results with respect to the application of 1H-MRS in PTSD. Finally, we discussed the implications of the findings with respect to current PTSD models and future research. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6T0J-4WKTWXP-3/2/01bf7907ca48f3a38450e510dcfe7526}

This paper uses evidence from field work completed on implementing settlement and shelter in post-tsunami Aceh and Sri Lanka to examine whether or not the theory and practice of `build back better' were witnessed. Focusing on settlement and shelter, four areas are examined: (i) safety, security, and livelihoods; (ii) how post-disaster settlement and shelter could have an improved connection with permanent housing and communities (the `transition to what?' question); (iii) fairness and equity; and (iv) connecting relief and development by tackling root causes of vulnerability. Based on the field work, addressing these four areas is suggested as how `build back better' could be implemented. Recommendations are 1. Community involvement is essential, but that does not necessarily mean community control. 2. Organizations involved in implementing transitional settlement and shelter need to consider their capacity and links to other sectors. 3. Thinking ahead is necessary by integrating relief and development through long-term planning and disaster risk reduction. Overall, `building back safer'might be a preferable tagline to `building back better' because `better' has multiple interpretations, many of which caused further problems, whereas `safer' provides a clearer goal on which to focus for post-disaster settlement and shelter.},

The analysis is carried out within an econometric model of population health in 19 countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries using panel data covering three different time periods. Social capital is measured by the proportion of people who say that that they generally trust other people and by membership in voluntary associations. The model performs well in explaining health outcomes. We find very little statistically significant evidence that the standard indicators of social capital have a positive effect on population health. By contrast, per capita income and the proportion of health expenditure financed by the government are both significantly and positively associated with better health outcomes. The paper casts doubt upon the widely accepted hypothesis that social capital has a positive effect on health and illustrates the importance of testing this kind of hypothesis in an extended model.},

"Ke nya 's climate varies from tropical along the coast to temperate inland to arid in the north and northeast parts of the country. The area receives a great deal of sunshine every month, and summer clothes are worn throughout the year. It is usually cool at night and early in the morning inland at higher elevations. The "long rains" season occurs from March/April to May/June. The "short rains" season occurs from October to November/December. The rainfall is sometimes heavy and often falls in the afternoons and evenings. The temperature remains high throughout these months of tropical rain. The hottest period is February and March, leading into the season of the long rains, and the coldest is in July and August." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_7KN4JIVE/4}{ :4})

On 11 May, the MSF intervention team assessed Kikwit General Hospital. This initial assessment revealed a nonfunctional isolation ward for suspected EHF cases; a lack of water and electricity; no waste disposal system; and no protective gear for medical staff. The priorities set by MSF were to establish a functional isolation ward to deal with EHF and to distribute protective supplies to individuals who were involved with patient care. Before the intervention, 67 health workers contracted EHF; after the initiation of control measures, just 3 cases were reported among health staff and none among Red Cross volunteers involved in body burial.},

Geweke's autoregressive formulation of Granger causality is used to find linear transfer entropy, and Schreiber's general, non-parametric, information-theoretic formulation is used to detect non-linear transfer entropy. We first validate these measures against synthetic data. Then we apply these measures to detect causality between social sentiment and cryptocurrency prices. We perform significance tests by comparing the information transfer against a null hypothesis, determined via shuffled time series, and calculate the Z-score. We also investigate different approaches for partitioning in nonparametric density estimation which can improve the significance of results. Using these techniques on sentiment and price data over a 48-month period to August 2018, for four major cryptocurrencies, namely bitcoin (BTC), ripple (XRP), litecoin (LTC) and ethereum (ETH), we detect significant information transfer, on hourly timescales, in directions of both sentiment to price and of price to sentiment. We report the scale of non-linear causality to be an order of magnitude greater than linear causality.},

"What is systemic change? The DCED Standard recommends that programmes assess the changes that they facilitate in the system or market, often referred to as systemic change. This enables practitioners to learn more about the market system, track the emerging results of their intervention, and continually adapt their approach to increase their impact. It will also enable programmes to assess and report the full range of benefits that they are contributing to, demonstrating the value of a market systems development approach. As discussed above, a precise definition of systemic change has proved elusive. We provide a broad definition here, and three 'rules of thumb' to help identify whether a change can credibly be considered systemic" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JXAAI4TV?page=4}{Kessler 2021:4})
\par
"We propose three rules of thumb to identify whether a change is 'systemic'. Firstly, systemic change should be sustainable, continuing without ongoing input from the programme. Secondly, systemic change should be scalable, capable of benefitting increasing numbers of people over time. Finally, systemic change should be resilient, adapting and enduring despite changes in circumstances" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/JXAAI4TV?page=5}{Kessler 2021:5})}

Methods Modified versions of the DSM-III-R PTSD module from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule and of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview were administered to a representative national sample of 5877 persons aged 15 to 54 years in the part II subsample of the National Comorbidity Survey. Results The estimated lifetime prevalence of PTSD is 7.8\%. Prevalence is elevated among women and the previously married. The traumas most commonly associated with PTSD are combat exposure and witnessing among men and rape and sexual molestation among women. Posttraumatic stress disorder is strongly comorbid with other lifetime DSM-III-R disorders. Survival analysis shows that more than one third of people with an index episode of PTSD fail to recover even after many years. Conclusions Posttraumatic stress disorder is more prevalent than previously believed, and is often persistent. Progress in estimating age-at-onset distributions, cohort effects, and the conditional probabilities of PTSD from different types of trauma will require future epidemiologic studies to assess PTSD for all lifetime traumas rather than for only a small number of retrospectively reported "most serious" traumas.}

There are many ways identified in the literature for carrying out assisted valuation. One way of assisting the valuation process is the use of evaluative rubrics. This practice-based article unpacks the learnings of a group of evaluators who have used evaluative rubrics to grapple with this challenge. Compared to their previous practice, evaluative rubrics have allowed them to surface and deal with values in a more transparent way. In their experience when evaluators and evaluation stakeholders get clearer about values, evaluative judgments become more credible and warrantable.},

This article argues that when addressing an evaluative question about an economic problem (the merit, worth, or significance of resource use), economic analysis can enhance evaluation but is usually insufficient to fully answer the evaluative question and that a stronger approach would involve explicit evaluative reasoning, supported by judicious use of economic and other methods. An overarching theoretical framework is proposed, and implications for evaluation practice are discussed.},

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The experimental group consisted of 187 randomly selected women living in Mostar, who were exposed to a wide spectrum of traumatic events during the war. The control group included 180 women living in the area surrounding Mostar who were not directly exposed to war destruction. Demographic data were obtained and a battery of psychological tests was used to measure the level of war traumatization and PTSD symptoms, along with the perception of social support. RESULTS: Women in the experimental group had significantly lower levels of perceived social support from friends (t=2.91; p{$<$}0.05) and coworkers (t=2.30; p{$<$}0.05). However, its protective significance for all levels of posttraumatic symptoms was strong, even stronger than social support from the family. Of all the sources of emotional social support, low level of perceived support from friends is the only significant predictor of PTSD. CONCLUSION: The sources of social support which the traumatized women drew from family, friends and coworkers change their significance depending on their availability. These sources are a strong predictive factor of PTSD development.},

It describes broad outcome categories against which activists, donors and evaluators can assess progress (or lack thereof) in an ongoing manner: changes in organisational capacity, base of support, alliances, data and analysis from a social justice perspective, problem definition and potential policy options, visibility, public norms, and population level impacts. Using these for evaluation enables activists and donors to learn from and rethink their strategies as the political context and/or actors change over time. The paper presents a case study comparing factors that facilitated reproductive rights policy wins during the transition from apartheid to democracy in South Africa and factors that undermined their implementation in the post-apartheid period. It argues that after legal and policy victories had been won, failure to maintain strong organizations and continually rethink strategies contributed to the loss of government focus on and resources for implementation of new policies. By implication, evaluating effectiveness only by an actual policy change does not allow for ongoing learning to ensure appropriate strategies. It also fails to recognise that a policy win can be overturned and needs vigilant monitoring and advocacy for implementation. This means that funding and organising advocacy should seldom be undertaken as a short-term proposition. It also suggests that the building and maintenance of organisational and leadership capacity is as important as any other of the outcome categories in enabling success. \textcopyright{} 2011 Foundation Review.},

  abstract = {Understanding the extent to which an intervention `works' can provide compelling evidence to decision-makers, although without an accompanying explanation of how an intervention works, this evidence can be difficult to apply in other settings, ultimately impeding its usefulness in making judicious and evidence-informed decisions. In this paper, we describe causal chain analysis as involving the development of a logic model, which outlines graphically a hypothesis of how an intervention leads to a change in an outcome. This logic model is then used to anchor subsequent decisions in the systematic review process, including decisions on synthesis. In this paper, we outline the steps taken in building a logic model, which usually consists of a series of boxes depicting intervention components and processes, outputs, and outcomes with arrows depicting connecting relationships. The nature of these connecting relationships and their basis in causality are considered, through a focus on complex causal relationships and the way in which contextual factors about the intervention setting or population may moderate these. We also explore the way in which specific combinations of intervention components may lead to successful interventions. Evidence synthesis techniques are discussed in the context of causal chain analysis, and their usefulness in exploring different parts of the causal chain or different types of relationship. The approaches outlined in this paper aim to assist systematic reviewers in producing findings that are useful to decision-makers and practitioners, and in turn, help to confirm existing theories or develop entirely new ways of understanding how interventions effect change.},

  abstract = {Schools and families share responsibilities for the socialisation and education of the child. The involvement of parents in the life of schools and their participation in school activities and decision- making is a major vehicle for constructing shared goals and co-ordinated practices. A large-scale study was conducted in ten \{SEE\} countries: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Romania and Serbia. The analysis of legislative acts and other documentation revealed that educational bodies with parental participation are regularly found at the school level, such as school boards and parent councils, while representation is negligible above the school level. Schools in all \{SEE\} countries have school boards with decision-making power in which parents also participate, with varying shares, although their number never prevails. A total of 11,125 parents were surveyed with structured face-to-face interviews, selected by stratified random sampling. The stratification was undertaken according to relevant geographical regions and by the location of the community served by the school (urban/rural). 30 schools were selected from each country and between 20 and 40 parents were randomly chosen from each school, proportional to the size of the school as well as five parents' representatives. In each country, a booster sample of parents was interviewed from two additional schools in communities which contained a high proportion of inhabitants who are Roma (except in Moldova, where other excluded communities were targeted). The main structure of the sample (including the main sample, parent representatives samples and Roma booster samples) was the following: \textbullet{} Sample A (mainstream \textendash{} regular parents sample): 9058 \textbullet{} Sample E (Roma parents from the excluded parents sample): 504 \textbullet{} Sample B (parents' representatives sample): 1354 \textbullet{} Parent representatives from Sample E school: 85 \textbullet{} Sample E (non-Roma parents from the excluded parents sample): 124 The questionnaire which was the basis for the interviews captured the following data: \textbullet{} socio-economic data on the child's family (wealth indicator, education level, education aspirations etc.) and basic information about the child (age, gender, school achievement etc.); \textbullet{} a report on participation in school life, which combined Epstein's dimensions of participation (whether the school invites parents to participate according to each dimension) with basic characteristics of the participation process (how parents feel about it, do they participate if invited, do they assess it as useful, are they motivated, do they feel competent etc.); \textbullet{} mediating variables \textendash{} self-reports on the motivation of parents, their beliefs about school-parent partnerships and perceptions of school openness, and of the work of the parent representatives; and \textbullet{} a self-assessment of parents' satisfaction with the child's well-being and progress at school, the communication with the school and with the influence the parent can exert. Parent representatives and parents from minority groups were surveyed with special additional sets of questions.},

  abstract = {Many public health programmes require individuals to comply with particular behaviours that are novel to them, for example, acquiring new eating habits, accepting immunizations or taking a new medication. In particular, mass drug administration programmes only work to reduce the prevalence of a disease if significant proportions of the target population take the drug in question. In such cases, knowledge of the factors most likely to lead to high levels of compliance is crucial to the programme's success. Existing models of compliance tend to either address interpersonal, organizational or psychological causes independently. Here, the authors present a formal method for analysing relevant factors in the situational context of the compliant behaviour, identifying how these factors may interact within the individual. This method was developed from semantic network analysis, augmented to include environmental and demographic variables to show causal linkages - hence the name 'causal chain mapping'. The ability of this method to provide significant insight into the actual behaviour of individuals is demonstrated with examples from a mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis in Alor District, Indonesia. The use of this method is likely to help identify key components influencing compliance, and thus make any public health programme reliant on the adoption of novel behaviours more effective. \textcopyright{} The Author 2011; all rights reserved.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is widely accepted that disease prevention efforts should consider cultural factors when addressing the needs of diverse populations, yet there is surprisingly little evidence that doing so enhances effectiveness. The Institute of Medicine has called for randomized studies directly comparing approaches that do and do not consider culture. METHODS: In a randomized trial, 1227 lower-income African-American women from 10 urban public health centers were assigned to either a usual care control group, or to receive a series of six women's health magazines with content tailored to each individual. By random assignment, these magazines were generated from either behavioral construct tailoring (BCT), culturally relevant tailoring (CRT) or both (BCT + CRT). The CRT magazines were based on four cultural constructs: religiosity, collectivism, racial pride, and time orientation. All tailored magazines sent to women ages 40-65 promoted use of mammography; magazines sent to women ages 18-39 promoted fruit and vegetable (FV) intake. Analyses examined changes from baseline to 18-month follow-up in use of mammography and servings of FV consumed daily. RESULTS: Women receiving BCT + CRT magazines were more likely than those in the BCT, CRT, and control groups to report getting a mammogram (76\% vs. 65\% vs. 64\% vs. 55\%, respectively), and had greater increases in FV servings consumed daily (+0.96 vs. + 0.43 vs. + 0.25 vs. + 0.59). CONCLUSIONS: Systematically integrating culture into tailored cancer prevention and control interventions may enhance their effectiveness in diverse populations.},

  abstract = {AIM: The examined differences and specificities of psychological symptoms between two groups of subject with experience and without experience under siege and war operations. METHODS: The sample includes two groups of 50 subjects. The first group experienced the trauma of siege and war operations, and the second group were living in the place without siege and war operations. The following measures were used: General Questionnaire social and demographic characteristics of the subjects before and after the war, SCL-90-R by the author Derogatis, for the registration of psychopathological symptoms, Mississippi Questionnaire by the Keane, for PTSD. RESULTS: The drop in social and economic status is much more profound in subjects who experienced the trauma of siege and war operations compared to other group without the trauma of siege and war operations. All nine SCL 90-R subscales show statistically significant difference in more pronounced psychopathological responses in subjects who experienced the trauma of siege and war operations relative to subjects without the trauma of siege and war operations. The Mississippi questionnaire shows significant differences in PTSD between the two groups and higher scores for the subjects who experienced the trauma of siege and war operations. CONCLUSION: Based on the results war is the most intense form of trauma leading to intensive psychopathological responses including chronic PTSD. Results show that the psychopathological response is most intense and most frequent in the population of subjects who experienced the trauma of siege and war operations compared to the other group without the trauma of siege and war operations.},

  abstract = {An effective state is essential to achieving socio-economic and sustainable development. With the advent of globalization, there are growing pressures on governments and organizations around the world to be more responsive to the demands of internal and external stakeholders for good governance, accountability and transparency, greater development effectiveness, and delivery of tangible results. Governments, parliaments, citizens, the private sector, NGOs, civil society, international organizations and donors are among the stakeholders interested in better performance. As demands for greater accountability and real results have increased, there is an attendant need for enhanced results-based monitoring and evaluation of policies, programs, and projects.This Handbook provides a comprehensive ten-step model that will help guide development practitioners through the process of designing and building a results-based monitoring and evaluation system. These steps begin with a "Readiness Assessment" and take the practitioner through the design, management, and more importantly, the sustainability of such systems. Ten Steps to a Results-Based Monitoring and Evaluation System describes each step in detail, the tasks needed to complete each one, and the tools available to help along the way.},

The children's symptoms were assessed in 1994 while the war was still going on and 30 months later when the war was over. In addition to changes in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms over time, the study examined the predictive power of (a) different types and number of war traumata, (b) loss of social community, (c) the children's demographic characteristics (age and gender), (d) types of coping strategies and locus of control, and (e) the perceived availability of different kinds of social support. Although symptoms of posttraumatic stress declined over time, 10\% of the children reported a severe level of symptomatology 30 months after the war. The results supported the hypothesized predictive power of all investigated factors for predicting short- and long-term posttraumatic stress reactions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Public health interventions are complex by nature, and their evaluation requires unpacking their intervention logic and their interactions with open social systems. By focusing on the interrelationships between context, mechanism, and outcome, Pawson and Tilley's realist approach appears a promising innovation for public health-related evaluation works. However, and as expected of any methodological innovation, this approach is being constructed gradually by answering the multiple challenges to its operationalization that fall in its path. One of these challenges, users of this approach agree on, is the necessity of clarifying its key concept of mechanism.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nMETHOD: We first collected the definitions of mechanism from published works of Pawson and colleagues. Secondly, a scoping review was conducted to identify the ones quoted by users of the realist approach for evaluating public health interventions (1997-2012). We then appraised the clarity and precision of this concept against the three dimensions defined by Daigneault and Jacobs "term, sense and referent."\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nRESULTS: Of the 2344 documents identified in the scoping review, 49 documents were included. Term: Users of the realist approach use adjectives qualifying the term mechanism that were not specifically endorsed by Pawson and colleagues. Sense: None of the attributes stated by Pawson and colleagues has been listed in all of the documents analyzed, and some contributions clarified its attributes. Referent: The concept of mechanism within a realist approach can be ascribed to theory-based evaluation, complex social interventions, and critical realism.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nCONCLUSION: This review led us to reconsider the concept of mechanism within the realist approach by confronting the theoretical stance of its proponents to the practical one of its users. This resulted in a clearer, more precise definition of the concept of mechanism which may in turn trigger further improvements in the way the realist approach is applied in evaluative practice in public health and potentially beyond. A mechanism is hidden but real, is an element of reasoning and reactions of agents in regard to the resources available in a given context to bring about changes through the implementation of an intervention, and evolves within an open space-time and social system of relationships.},

The measures could be used to compare the maps of different individuals and also to track the changes in the beliefs of a single individual over time. They would assist in providing a more objective basis for qualitative analysis. In this paper we review current cognitive mapping research and then propose some measures for computing the difference between two maps, illustrating this work with a managerial example.},

  abstract = {Increasingly, thoughtful managers recognize the role of knowledge and learning in corporate action and performance. Concurrently, a new field, management and organization cognition (MOC), has emerged producing useful insights and findings. Thus far, empirical studies have largely focused on single cases or actors, using often archival data and sometimes ambiguous methods. To advance the field will require pragmatic tools for eliciting data on.thinking in real organizations and for conducting rigorous and more comparative studies of management and organization cognitions. This paper describes a method for comparatively studying real-life managerial thinking, defined here as the respective manager's beliefs about key phenomena and their efficacy links in their strategic and operative situation. The applicability of such a definition will depend on the requirements of research at hand. The payoff is that, thus defined, key elements in managerial and organizational cognitions can be usefully captured by cognitive mapping, an established approach in MOC research. The approach contains, first, a method for eliciting comparison-enabling interview data of several subjects. Then, using researcher-based, interpretive standardization of the individual natural discourses, databases of standard concepts and causal links, constituting the cause map elements, are distilled. This facilitates a text-oriented description of the thinking patterns of single actors like managers or organizational groups, which can be used in traditional-type mapping studies, which typically assume unitary or quasi-unitary actors. However, the method is intended for comparative analyses, e.g., for pinpointing the cognitive differences or similarities across organizational actors or for constructing and comparing groups, assumed cognitively homogenous. Also, it is applicable for longitudinal studies or aggregated, e.g., industry-level, descriptions of MOC. A PC application is available for the technique, although many of the processing tasks are amenable to general-purpose relational database software. The paper presents a study case comparing the cognitive structures of managers in two interrelated industries in terms. of their concept bases and causal beliefs. The objective was to understand the substance of management thinking, as well as the formative logic behind how managers come to think in the shared ways. It is shown that patterns of industry-typical core causal thinking, manifestations of a dominant logic or recipe, can be located, operationalized and comparatively analyzed with this method. Substantively, the contents of management thinking are typically products of complex long-term mechanisms. These consist, first, of organizational problem-solving, recurrently facing a specific, adequately stable constellation of strategic tasks and environment elements, similar within industries and systematically different across them, and, second, of various social processes, which directly transfer and influence management thinking. The paper concludes with discussing the cause mapping method and suggests some options for further studies.},

The second purpose is to enable the discerned study prototypes by introducing a new CCM software application, CMAP3. Building upon the distinction between theorycentred (etic) and participantcentred (emic) perspectives in social research, we first construct and apply a conceptual framework for analysing and categorising extant CCM studies in terms of their objectives and basic design. Next, after noting the important role and basic tasks in computerising causal mapping studies, we present a new CCM software application. The theorycentred/participantcentred perspectives define four causal mapping study prototypes, each with different goals, basic designs and methodological requirements. Noting the present lack of widely accessible software for qualitatively oriented CCM studies, we introduce CMAP3, a new noncommercial Windows application, and summarise how it is used in related research. The framework and the studies representing the prototypes demonstrate the versatility of CCM methods and that the proposed framework offers a new, systematic approach to categorising and designing CCM studies. Research technically, CMAP3 can support the defined CCMprototypes, based on a lowstructured (inductive/qualitative) or a structured (nomothetic/quantitative) methodological approach/stance, and having therefore different needs of data acquisition, processing, coding, aggregation/comparison, and analysis of the emerging aggregated cause maps' contents or structure. \textcopyright{} 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

Twenty years later theory as understood in the field of evaluation is fragmented, a problem widely recognized in the evaluation community. The goal of this article is to make a modest contribution to clarifying this situation. We first present two typologies of evaluation theory and invite readers to join us in a discussion of the pros and cons of these typologies. We then present an impressionistic picture, mainly qualitative, of how `theory' has featured in past issues of this journal. Many articles with a theoretical orientation have been published in Evaluation providing a rich though somewhat diffuse picture in which many of the types identified in our typologies are represented. Finally several suggestions are put forward to further strengthen the development of theoretical work in the evaluation profession. These are `theory knitting', `theory layering' and `theory-driven evaluation science'. Keywords},

  abstract = {In order to make sense of the world, humans tend to see causation almost everywhere. Although most causal relations may seem straightforward, they are not always construed in the same way cross-culturally. In this study, we investigate concepts of "chance," "coincidence," or "randomness" that refer to assumed relations between intention, action, and outcome in situations, and we ask how people from different cultures make sense of such non-law-like connections. Based on a framework proposed by Alicke (2000), we administered a task that aims to be a neutral tool for investigating causal construals cross-culturally and cross-linguistically. Members of four different cultural groups, rural Mayan Yucatec and Tseltal speakers from Mexico and urban students from Mexico and Germany, were presented with a set of scenarios involving various types of causal and non-causal relations and were asked to explain the described events. Three links varied as to whether they were present or not in the scenarios: Intention-to-Action, Action-to-Outcome, and Intention-to-Outcome. Our results show that causality is recognized in all four cultural groups. However, how causality and especially non-law-like relations are interpreted depends on the type of links, the cultural background and the language used. In all three groups, Action-to-Outcome is the decisive link for recognizing causality. Despite the fact that the two Mayan groups share similar cultural backgrounds, they display different ideologies regarding concepts of non-law-like relations. The data suggests that the concept of "chance" is not universal, but seems to be an explanation that only some cultural groups draw on to make sense of specific situations. Of particular importance is the existence of linguistic concepts in each language that trigger ideas of causality in the responses from each cultural group.},

In order to relate indicators of environmental pressure to indicators of environmental state changes, time scales specific to that pressure should be used. We review the different ways in which temporal aspects have been dealt with in CSR and other reporting schemes and show that there is often no consistent and rigorous treatment of time.

Based on a review of East-West cultural differences in dialectical emotions, or co-occurring positive and negative feelings, we predicted culture to influence the association between positive emotions and depression, but not the association between negative emotions and depression. As predicted, in a survey of over 600 European-, immigrant Asian-, and Asian American college students, positive emotions were associated with depression symptoms among European Americans and Asian Americans, but not immigrant Asians. Negative emotions were associated with depression symptoms among all three groups. We also found initial evidence that acculturation (i.e., nativity) may influence the role of positive emotions in depression: Asian Americans fell ``in between'' the two other groups. These findings suggest the importance of studying the role of culture in positive emotions and in positive psychology. The use of interventions based on promoting positive emotions in clinical psychology among Asian clients is briefly discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2011 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A substantial scale-up in public health response is needed to control the unprecedented Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in west Africa. Current international commitments seek to expand intervention capacity in three areas: new EVD treatment centres, case ascertainment through contact tracing, and household protective kit allocation. We aimed to assess how these interventions could be applied individually and in combination to avert future EVD cases and deaths. METHODS: We developed a transmission model of Ebola virus that we fitted to reported EVD cases and deaths in Montserrado County, Liberia. We used this model to assess the effectiveness of expanding EVD treatment centres, increasing case ascertainment, and allocating protective kits for controlling the outbreak in Montserrado. We varied the efficacy of protective kits from 10\% to 50\%. We compared intervention initiation on Oct 15, 2014, Oct 31, 2014, and Nov 15, 2014. The status quo intervention was defined in terms of case ascertainment and capacity of EVD treatment centres on Sept 23, 2014, and all behaviour and contact patterns relevant to transmission as they were occurring at that time. The primary outcome measure was the expected number of cases averted by Dec 15, 2014. FINDINGS: We estimated the basic reproductive number for EVD in Montserrado to be 2{$\cdot$}49 (95\% CI 2{$\cdot$}38-2{$\cdot$}60). We expect that allocating 4800 additional beds at EVD treatment centres and increasing case ascertainment five-fold in November, 2014, can avert 77 312 (95\% CI 68 400-85 870) cases of EVD relative to the status quo by Dec 15, 2014. Complementing these measures with protective kit allocation raises the expectation as high as 97 940 (90 096-105 606) EVD cases. If deployed by Oct 15, 2014, equivalent interventions would have been expected to avert 137 432 (129 736-145 874) cases of EVD. If delayed to Nov 15, 2014, we expect the interventions will at best avert 53 957 (46 963-60 490) EVD cases. INTERPRETATION: The number of beds at EVD treatment centres needed to effectively control EVD in Montserrado substantially exceeds the 1700 pledged by the USA to west Africa. Accelerated case ascertainment is needed to maximise effectiveness of expanding the capacity of EVD treatment centres. Distributing protective kits can further augment prevention of EVD, but it is not an adequate stand-alone measure for controlling the outbreak. Our findings highlight the rapidly closing window of opportunity for controlling the outbreak and averting a catastrophic toll of EVD cases and deaths. FUNDING: US National Institutes of Health.},

CG is characterized by a unique pattern of symptoms following bereavement that are typically slow to resolve and can persist for years if left untreated. This paper will demonstrate that existing diagnoses are not sufficient, as the phenomenology, risk factors, clinical correlates, course, and outcomes for CG are distinct from those of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and adjustment disorder (AD). It is argued that the establishment of CG as a diagnostic entity is essential because its symptoms are associated with enduring mental and physical health morbidity and require specifically designed clinical interventions. We conduct a critical review of all published evidence on this topic to date, demonstrating that the advantages of standardizing the diagnostic criteria of CG outweigh the disadvantages. In addition, recommendations for future lines of research are made. This paper concludes that CG must be established in the current nosology to address the needs of individuals who are significantly suffering and impaired by this disorder.

The examination of more than 45 quantitative and qualitative studies finds that relationships with older partners and those that involve economic transactions are common and that these asymmetries are associated with unsafe sexual behaviors and increased risk of HIV infection. Although the reasons that adolescent girls engage in sexual relationships with older men are varied, receipt of financial benefits is a major motivation. The literature presents evidence that girls have considerable negotiating power over certain aspects of sexual relationships with older men, including partnership formation and continuation; however, they have little control over sexual practices within partnerships, including condom use and violence. The review discusses directions for further research and the implications of current knowledge for future interventions.},

We find that while almost all users increased their online activity after the earthquake, Japanese speakers, who are assumed to be more directly affected by the event, expanded the network of people they interact with to a much higher degree than English speakers or the global average. By investigating the evolution of communities, we find that the behavior of joining or quitting a community is far from random: users tend to stay in their current status and are less likely to join new communities from solitary or shift to other communities from their current community. While non-Japanese speakers did not change their conversation topics significantly after the earthquake, nearly all Japanese users changed their conversations to earthquake-related content. This study builds a systematic framework for investigating human behaviors under extreme events with online social network data and our findings on the dynamics of networks and communities may provide useful insight for understanding how patterns of social interaction are influenced by extreme events.},

With respect to mechanisms, I argue that the core of process tracing with causal inference is the identification of mechanisms understood as intervening events. Events are different from standard intervening variables when used with process tracing, because events are treated as sets in which cases can have membership. With respect to Bayesian analysis, I concur with recent writings that suggest Bayesian inference is at the heart of process tracing. The Bayesian nature of process tracing explains why it is inappropriate to view qualitative research as suffering from a small-N problem and certain standard causal identification problems. More generally, the paper shows how the power of process tracing as a qualitative methodology depends on and grows from its set-theoretic underpinnings.},

Although it is widely recognized that the selection of negative cases is consequential for theory testing, methodologists have yet to formulate specific rules to inform this selection process. In this paper, we propose a principle-the Possibility Principle-that provides explicit, rigorous, and theoretically informed guidelines for choosing a set of negative cases. The Possibility Principle advises researchers to select only negative cases where the outcome of interest is possible. Our discussion elaborates this principle and its implications for current debates about case selection and strategies of theory testing. Major points are illustrated with substantive examples from studies of revolution, economic growth, welfare states, and war. CR - Copyright \&\#169; 2004 American Political Science Association},

Presently, the growing reputation of social networks has given us with an opportunity to analyze these well-studied phenomena over different networks at different scales.

In a social network, actors tend to connect with each other on the basis of their perceived social hierarchy. The emergence of such a hierarchy within a social community shows the manner in which authority manifests in the community. In the case of signed networks, the concept of social hierarchy can be interpreted as the emergence of a tree-like structure comprising of actors in a top-down fashion in the order of their ranks, describing a specific parent-child relationship, viz. child trusts parent. However, owing to the presence of positive as well as negative interactions in signed networks, deriving such ``trust hierarchies'' is a non-trivial challenge.

  abstract = {This overview aims to stimulate conceptual and practical discussions to help unlock the full potential of realist evaluation in health systems research. Based on a structured literature search, this review maps how the concepts of realist evaluation are applied in health systems research and which methodological problems are encountered. We found a great diversity in the depth of application of the philosophical concepts, use of terminology and scope of application in the research process. Terms of theory-driven evaluation, theories of change and realist evaluation are often used interchangeably. Diverging views exist regarding the nature of 'mechanism' and the difference between mechanism and essential context condition. A lack of methodological guidance was highlighted by many authors. Realist evaluation is slowly gaining traction in health systems research, but more clarity is needed concerning the definitions of mechanisms and context and how the configuration of context, mechanism and intervention can be described and assessed.},

Seventy-seven percent of the subject had identical positive/negative PTSD evaluation on both scales. There was statistically significant correlation between the intensity of PTSD symptoms measured by the two scales.

  abstract = {In 1987, the authors of Our common future argued that unless the world embraced and operationalized sustainable development, it would risk being overwhelmed by a series of interlocking crises related to population growth, urbanization, poverty and environmental degradation. Since then, many authors have argued that the world is on a worst case scenario trajectory. Post-Rio assessments of progress towards sustainable development have been largely negative. Since 1987, climate change has added a new stressor to the mix while shortening the time frame for transformation. In the context of accelerating change and converging stresses is the concept of sustainable development as compelling today as it was twenty years ago? Is it reasonable to believe there are means by which to reduce poverty and simultaneously protect the environment? This article briefly reviews the global challenges that first stimulated the concept of sustainable development and asks how contemporary processes of global change are affecting both these challenges and this approach to addressing them. While there are some grounds for optimism, several variables are identified that make sustainable development increasingly difficult to design and implement. The article concludes with an evaluation of how these difficulties might be overcome, and why it is essential that we try. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

"fi rst was to assess the baseline capacity of the Kebele Disaster Preparedness Committees (KDPCs) \textendash{} the primary unit through which the ACRP is to be implemented. Given the nature of the project, it is expected that during its short duration, the major impact would be on these institutions" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_TS962D43/9}{ :9})
\par
"second was to assess the understanding and prioritization of hazards and how communities perceive vulnerability" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_TS962D43/9}{ :9})
\par
"third was to assess baseline livelihood conditions in the kebeles served by ACRP." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_TS962D43/9}{ :9})

"There is a strong consensus on the major hazards facing Tsaeda Amba communities, although this list would vary over time. Drought is the perennial constant; high food price infl ation is a current concern that would not have been mentioned a few years ago." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_TS962D43/9}{ :9})

"although the proportion of food was lower than the earlier" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_TS962D43/10}{ :10})
\par
"it will be diffi cult to determine the impact of ACRP on livelihoods. Given that the project started during a very diffi cult time, assuming that the drought ends and food prices don't spike again, there will likely be some improvement in livelihood status over the coming years, but it cannot be attributed simply to program inputs."

"Many interventions that used to be labeled something else (for instance, food for work projects for soil and water conservation) are now labeled DRR \textendash{} but it isn't clear what is different or new about such approaches." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_TS962D43/11}{ :11})
\par
"Third, DRR is one area that is critical to bridging the gaps or building links between standard approaches to humanitarian and development work. But DRR is often treated programmatically as a stand-alone activity, and this critical linking role is often missed in program strategies" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_TS962D43/11}{ :11})

Likewise, DRR programs tend to focus heavily on covariate risk (hazards that affect nearly everyone in an affected geographic location \textendash{} such as drought, fl oods, earthquakes, etc.) but demonstrate a relative lack of clarity about the importance of reducing or mitigating idiosyncratic risk (hazards that may affect one individual, household or community but not necessarily a neighboring one)."

At the heart of contribution analysis is the aim to be able to make credible causal claims about the contribution an intervention is making to observed results. The key role that theories of change play is noted, and what a useful theory of change ought to contain is discussed. The article then makes a link between the philosophical discussions on causality and contribution analysis through a discussion of contributory causes. It is argued that such causes, which on their own are neither necessary nor sufficient, represent the kind of contribution role that many interventions play: where there are a number of other influencing events and conditions at work in addition to the intervention of interest. Contribution analysis is an approach to confirming that an intervention is a contributory cause.},

A number of examples of evidence-based theories of change in the area of agriculture research for nutrition and health are discussed, as is the need for different versions of a theory of change for different purposes.

This study investigated the impact of negative life change occurring in the year following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on levels of distress among 757 Red Cross Disaster Services Human Resources (national disaster team) employees and volunteers who responded to this disaster. Negative life change in the year following disaster response fully mediated the relationship between disaster response and symptoms of depression and partially mediated the responses between disaster response and posttraumatic stress and anxiety symptoms. Results highlight the importance of life experiences in the year following disaster response and, therefore, the education and follow-up services provided to disaster workers prior to and following disaster assignment. Suggestions for monitoring disaster-related stress during and following assignment are provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved)},

The volumes of this two-volume set of books cover issues pertaining to trauma psychology. Whether the traumatic stressor is violence, disaster, or illness or some other form of trauma the variable "social support" comes through as a key factor in resilience during the trauma and quick recovery after the trauma. While the volumes cover certain specific events like the 2001 World Trade Center attack, the 2004 Madrid terrorist attack, and the tsunami disaster in the Indian Ocean in 2004, the emphasis is not on characteristics of the stressors but rather on those aspects of intervention and prevention that can reduce the overall devastating effects of traumatic events. Readers of both volumes cannot fail to notice that regardless of the type of stressor, traumatic sequelae bear many similarities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved)},

  pages = {211--222},
  abstract = {Since the publication of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-III, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has become a remarkably dominant theme in mental health discourse and diagnostic practice. This development has been encouraged by the diagnosis being officially presumed to exist in acute, chronic, delayed, complex, subdromal, and even "masked" forms. Here, we present an historical and clinical review that indicates how, since 1980, the term PTSD (along with its dubious embellishments) replaced established views on mental responses to trauma to the detriment of patient care and psychiatric investigation. From this historical perspective, we review and evaluate the natural course of emotional and behavioral reactions to traumatic experiences, and as well their assessment, formulation, and therapeutic management in both civilian and military situations. From this we conclude that the concept of PTSD has moved the mental health field away from, rather than towards a better understanding of the natural psychological responses to trauma. A return to prior standards of diagnostic practice and therapeutic planning would greatly benefit patient care, rehabilitative services to veterans, and epidemiologic research.

"With regard to the development of indicators he distinguished indicators which focus on vulnerability directly and those who measure it indirectly like e.g. GDP. Moreover, he presented a community based approach for measuring vulnerability through sectors. As important sectors he defined for example health, education, housing, environment, finance, trade etc. He illustrated the approach with selected examples. Furthermore, he underlined the fact that this approach can also be used to assess communities. In this context features like the number of roads leading to the community, the type of main access roads and the existence of a health centre are characteristics which are taken into account. The approach implies a weighting and results in an aggregated number which indicates the state of vulnerability of a specific sector. He concluded that the framework is easy to perform but requires a specific survey." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_FTR5I2ID/11}{ :11})

"With regard to the development of indicators he  distinguished indicators which focus on vulnerability directly and those who measure it  indirectly like e.g. GDP. Moreover, he presented a community based approach for  measuring vulnerability through sectors. As important sectors he defined for example  health, education, housing, environment, finance, trade etc. He illustrated the approach  with selected examples. Furthermore, he underlined the fact that this approach can also be  used to assess communities. In this context features like the number of roads leading to  the community, the type of main access roads and the existence of a health centre are  characteristics which are taken into account. The approach implies a weighting and results  in an aggregated number which indicates the state of vulnerability of a specific sector. He  concluded that the framework is easy to perform but requires a specific survey." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_FTR5I2ID/11}{ :11})

  abstract = {Background: The 2014 epidemic of Ebola virus disease in parts of west Africa defines an unprecedented health threat. We developed a model of Ebola virus transmission that integrates detailed geographical and demographic data from Liberia to overcome the limitations of non-spatial approaches in projecting the disease dynamics and assessing non-pharmaceutical control interventions. Methods: We modelled the movements of individuals, including patients not infected with Ebola virus, seeking assistance in health-care facilities, the movements of individuals taking care of patients infected with Ebola virus not admitted to hospital, and the attendance of funerals. Individuals were grouped into randomly assigned households (size based on Demographic Health Survey data) that were geographically placed to match population density estimates on a grid of 3157 cells covering the country. The spatial agent-based model was calibrated with a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. The model was used to estimate Ebola virus transmission parameters and investigate the effectiveness of interventions such as availability of Ebola treatment units, safe burials procedures, and household protection kits. Findings: Up to Aug 16, 2014, we estimated that 38??3\% of infections (95\% CI 17??4-76??4) were acquired in hospitals, 30??7\% (14??1-46??4) in households, and 8??6\% (3??2-11??8) while participating in funerals. We noted that the movement and mixing, in hospitals at the early stage of the epidemic, of patients infected with Ebola virus and those not infected was a sufficient driver of the reported pattern of spatial spread. The subsequent decrease of incidence at country and county level is attributable to the increasing availability of Ebola treatment units (which in turn contributed to drastically decreased hospital transmission), safe burials, and distribution of household protection kits. Interpretation: The model allows assessment of intervention options and the understanding of their role in the decrease in incidence reported since Sept 7, 2014. High-quality data (eg, to estimate household secondary attack rate, contact patterns within hospitals, and effects of ongoing interventions) are needed to reduce uncertainty in model estimates.

The article also investigates whether the nature of the interactions with others moderates the personality-performance relations. The meta-analysis was based on 11 studies (total N = 1,586). each of which assessed the FFM at the construct level using the Personal Characteristics Inventory. Results support the hypothesis that Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, and Emotional Stability are positively related to performance in jobs involving interpersonal interactions. Results also support the hypothesis that Emotional Stability and Agreeableness are more strongly related to performance in jobs that involve team- work (where employees interact interdependently with coworkers), than in those that involve dyadic interactions with others (where employees provide a direct service to customers and clients). Implications for developing theories of work performance and for selecting employees are discussed.}

In proposing quantitative theories and claiming to measure the attributes involved, psychologists are logically committed to both tasks. However, they have adopted their own, special, definition of measurement, one that deflects attention away from the scientific task. It is argued that this is not accidental. From Fechner onwards, the dominant tradition in quantitative psychology ignored this task. Stevens' definition rationalized this neglect. The widespread acceptance of this definition within psychology made this neglect systemic, with the consequence that the implications of contemporary research in measurement theory for undertaking the scientific task are not appreciated. It is argued further that when the ideological support structures of a science sustain serious blind spots like this, then that science is in the grip of some kind of thought disorder. \textbackslash ldotsunluckily our professors of psychology in general are not up to quantitative logic\textbackslash ldots E.

A coherent and well-structured narrative is therefore essential for effective communication, confusion caused by a haphazard attempt at storytelling being a common experience. This also suggests that a scientific understanding of how a narrative is formed and delivered is key to understanding human communication and dialog. Here we show that the definition of a narrative lends itself naturally to network-based modeling and analysis, and they can be further enriched by incorporating various text analysis methods from computational linguistics. We model the temporally unfolding nature of narrative as a dynamical growing network of nodes and edges representing characters and interactions, which allows us to characterize the story progression using the network growth pattern. We also introduce the concept of an interaction map between characters based on associated sentiments and topics identified from the text that characterize their relationships explicitly. We demonstrate the methods via application to Victor Hugo's Les Mis\'erables. Going beyond simple, aggregate occurrence-based methods for narrative representation and analysis, our proposed methods show promise in uncovering its essential nature of a highly complex, dynamic system that reflects the rich structure of human interaction and communication.},

  abstract = {Complicated grief is likely to be common among refugee populations exposed to war trauma. However, there have been few studies investigating the traumatic antecedents and correlates of complicated grief in refugees, and the relationship of that symptom pattern with other common disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. We studied Bosnian refugees recruited from a community center in Sydney, Australia, with the sample being supplemented by a snowball method (N = 126; response rate, 86\%). Measures included a trauma inventory, the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), the depression module of the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID), and the Core Bereavement Items (CBI). A dimension of traumatic loss derived from the trauma inventory was a specific predictor of complicated grief, with exposure to human rights violations being associated with images of the traumatic events surrounding the lost person. There was no link between PTSD and grief other than for a low-order association with the PTSD intrusion dimension. In contrast, depression was strongly associated with grief and its subscales. Only the subgroup with comorbid grief and depression reported higher levels of traumatic loss. The results suggest that complicated grief in refugees can become persistent and associated with depression. While PTSD and grief share common symptoms of intrusion, the two symptom domains are sufficiently distinct to warrant independent assessment of grief in refugee populations.

Mental models research offers a suite of methods that can be used to reveal these understandings and how they might affect conservation outcomes. Mental models are representations in people's minds of how parts of the world work. We seek to demonstrate their value to conservation and assist practitioners and researchers in navigating the choices of methods available to elicit them. We begin by explaining some of the dominant applications of mental models in conservation: revealing individual assumptions about a system, developing a stakeholder-based model of the system, and creating a shared pathway to conservation. We then provide a framework to ``walk through'' the stepwise decisions in mental models research, with a focus on diagram-based methods. Finally, we discuss some of the limitations of mental models research and application that are important to consider. This work extends the use of mental models research in improving our ability to understand social-ecological systems, creating a powerful set of tools to inform and shape conservation initiatives.},

Since 1994, an intensive monitoring system has documented data on clients, interventions, and outcomes. This study focused on the systematic evaluation of counseling interventions aimed to alleviate the distress in wartime. The sample consisted of 3,283 and 1,785 inhabitants of Sarajevo, Zenica, Travnik, and Vitez who filled out the GHQ-28 and IES respectively. Pre- and post-assessments were compared throughout consecutive years (1994-1999) and across age groups and both sexes. Outcomes of these scales reflected very high scores, especially among people between 30 and 40 years of age. Furthermore, intake scores increased in time rather than decreased. Differences between pre- and postmeasurements are highly significant\textendash throughout the years.

  abstract = {Process evaluation is an essential part of designing and testing complex interventions. New MRC guidance provides a framework for conducting and reporting process evaluation studies Attempts to tackle problems such as smoking and obe-sity increasingly use complex interventions. These are commonly defined as interventions that comprise mul-tiple interacting components, although additional dimensions of complexity include the difficulty of their implementation and the number of organisational lev-els they target. 1 Randomised controlled trials are regarded as the gold standard for establishing the effectiveness of interventions, when randomisation is feasible. However, effect sizes do not provide policy makers with information on how an intervention might be replicated in their specific context, or whether trial outcomes will be reproduced. Earlier MRC guidance for evaluating complex interventions focused on ran-domised trials, making no mention of process evalua-tion. 2 Updated guidance recognised the value of process evaluation within trials, stating that it " can be used to assess fidelity and quality of implementation, clarify causal mechanisms and identify contextual fac-tors associated with variation in outcomes. " 3 However, it did not provide guidance for carrying out process evaluation. Developing guidance for process evaluation In 2010, a workshop funded by the MRC Population Health Science Research Network discussed the need for guidance on process evaluation. 4 There was consen-sus that researchers, funders, and reviewers would ben-efit from guidance. A group of researchers with experience and expertise in evaluating complex inter-ventions was assembled to produce the guidance. In line with the principles followed in developing earlier MRC guidance documents, draft guidance was pro-duced drawing on literature reviews, process evalua-tion case studies, workshops, and discussions at conferences and seminars. It was then circulated to aca-demic, policy, and practice stakeholders for comment. Around 30 stakeholders provided written comments on the draft structure, while others commented during conference workshops run throughout the development process. A full draft was recirculated for further review, before being revised and approved by key MRC funding panels. Although the aim was to provide guidance on pro-cess evaluation of public health interventions, the guidance is highly relevant to complex intervention research in other domains, such as health services and education. The full guidance (www.populationhealth-sciences.org/Process-Evaluation-Guidance.html) begins by setting out the need for process evaluation. It then presents a review of influential theories and frameworks which informed its development, before offering practical recommendations, and six detailed case studies. In this article, we provide an overview of the new framework and summarise our practical recommendations using one of the case studies as an example. MRC process evaluation framework The new framework builds on the process evaluation themes described in the 2008 MRC complex interven-tions guidance (fig 1). 3 Although the role of theory within evaluation is contested, 5 6 we concur with the position set out in the 2008 guidance, which argued that an understanding of the causal assumptions underpinning the intervention and use of evaluation to understand how interventions work in practice are vital in building an evidence base that informs policy and practice. 1 Causal assumptions may be drawn from social science theory, although complex interventions will often also be informed by other factors such as past experience or common sense. An intervention as simple as a health information leaflet, for example, may reflect an assumption that increased knowledge of health consequences will trigger behavioural change. Explicitly stating causal assumptions about how the intervention will work can allow external scrutiny of its plausibility and help evaluators decide which aspects of the intervention or its context to prioritise for inves-tigation. Our framework also emphasises the relations between implementation, mechanisms, and context. For example, implementation of a new intervention will be},

Thirty per cent of the participants without PTSD and 21.6\% of those without MDD met criteria for PGD. Women were more likely to have PGD than men. The immediate threat to life was significantly associated with an elevated risk for PTSD and MDD, but not PGD.Conclusion: The findings suggest that many cases of PGD would be missed by an exclusive focus on PTSD among bereaved war survivors.}

"The Evidence Request Bank Project devised an evidence to action (E2A) cycle, which includes three key stages: identifying gaps in knowledge; an evidence review process to gather, synthesise and present evidence in action-focused ways to address those gaps in knowledge; and planning evidence use" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EGWJQ7PY?page=2}{Morton 2018:156})

"6ouch Evidence synthesis for knowledge exchange 157 In this paper ideas of what constitutes evidence was open to discussion with practitioners involved in each synthesis process. Research evidence and published grey literature that were: relevant to the topic under investigation, seen as appropriate and relevant by both researchers and practitioners, and that met the quality criteria, were included in the term 'evidence'. Synthesising evidence for policy and practice Our experience of working with third and public sector organisations at the time highlighted lack of relevant, focused and robust reviews of literature which responded to their needs. Limitations of current methods for synthesising research were also apparent in the literature, for example the inability of the 'standard' Cochrane Collaboration type systematic review to accommodate variations in study design and acknowledge different types of research (Boaz et al, 2006). The value of qualitative evidence to inform policy and practice is increasingly recognised and methods for reviewing qualitative research in systematic ways are 8emerging (Thomas and Harden, 2008; Ring et al, 2011). Yet methods such as thematic 3synthesis (see Thomas and Harden, 2008) and realist synthesis (Pawson et al, 2005) 1require significant time and labour (Boaz et al, 2006; Saul et al, 2013), which are often 1 twith the available resources and policy or practice timeframe of third and public tor evidence users" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EGWJQ7PY?page=3}{Morton 2018:157})},

However, assessing the impact of social science research on policy and practice is challenging. The ways in which research is taken up, used, and reused in policy and practice settings means that linking research processes or outputs to wider changes is difficult, and timescales are hard to predict. This article proposes an empirically grounded framework for assessing the impact of research\textemdash the Research Contribution Framework. A case study approach was adopted to explore the nature of research impact and how it might be assessed. Findings were used to design, develop, and test a framework to assess the contribution of research to relevant areas of policy and practice and to articulate wider benefits. The framework has been adapted from contribution analysis, using the idea of `contribution' to help explain the ways research is taken up and used to influence policy and practice. The framework allows for a focus on the roles of research users, and examines both processes and outcomes. It is argued that this approach gets round some of the common problems in assessing impact. It provides a method of linking research and knowledge exchange to wider outcomes whilst acknowledging and including contextual factors that help or hinder research impact. It is practical, balancing robustness with feasibility. It is adaptable for a wide range of content, types of impact assessment, and purposes.},

"Forward tracking studies start with research and trace forward into policy or practice settings to investigate impact (MolasGallart et al. 2000; Nason et al. 2007). They are more common but rely heavily on the researcher's and research user's own recollections of research use (Nutley et al. 2007; Donovan 2011). Backward tracking approaches analyse a policy or practice setting to explore the use and impact of research (Gabbay and le May 2004; Smith 2007; Jung and Nutley 2008). In backward tracking studies, behaviour can be examined and tracked back to research. Specific interventions such as KE activity can be assessed. However, this type of assessment raises questions such as whether it will be possible to show impact of specific research projects or programmes" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D343J6K6?page=3}{Morton 2015:407})},

A review of 117 studies (published 1952-1988) yielded 162 samples totaling 23,994 Ss. Conscientiousness showed consistent relations with all job performance criteria for all occupational groups. Extraversion was a valid predictor for 2 occupations involving social interaction, (managers and sales). Also, openness to experience and extraversion were valid predictors of the training proficiency criterion across occupations.

Although TBCMs have been used extensively in organizational behavior and strategic management research, studies assessing the psychometric properties of TBCM measures are virtually nonexistent. With the intention of facilitating large-sample substantive research using TBCMs, the authors examine the construct validity of two most frequently employed structural properties of TBCMs: complexity and centrality. In assessing construct validity, they examine the internal consistency, dimensionality, and predictive validity of the structural properties. The results suggest that complexity is not a general cognitive attribute. Rather, it is indicative of domain knowledge. On the other hand, centrality, which reflects the degree of hierarchy characterizing the TBCM, is related to cognitive ability and may reflect general information processing. Moreover, complexity and centrality, but not cognitive ability, predicted student performance.},

  abstract = {Abstract In this chapter, / provide an historical overview of the use of causal mapping, and its migration from political science to organization theory, and more recently into research efforts in Information Technology (IT). Since this migration has brought in its wake a diversity of perspectives and approaches, a secondary objective of this chapter is to sketch this diversity. I discuss the diversity in perspectives, research contexts and focus. Three perspectives (social constructionist, objectivist, and expert- anchored), four research contexts (discovery, hypothesis testing, evocative and intervention) and three types offoci (content, structure and behavior) are summarized. Introduction A remarkable revolution is underway in the organization sciences: A new generation of scholars is enthusiastically bringing the role of the human mind back into the study of organizations. Unlike the deterministic views of man expounded by Skinner or of organizations promulgated by the early contingency theorists such as Lawrence and Lorsch, this new breed of scholars takes inspiration from the works of Barnard, Simon and Weick, and pays serious attention to human cognitive processes. Their cognitive agenda is enabled by the availability ofnew research tools that have made possible the study Of thought using "normal science" approaches. Indeed, these new tools have reached a level Of maturity as witnessed by their increasingly frequent use in papers published in major management journals ( Narayanan \& Kemmerer, 2001 One ofthese tools that has great potential for advancing research in managerial cognition is causal mapping. Causal maps represent thought as a network of causal relations, representing concepts through nodes and causality though links between nodes. They invoke the notion of causation, and users of the tool observe that causal analysis is built into our natural language, while side-stepping the philosophical challenges associated with the notion ofcausality. In recent years, this tool has been considered one of the most effective ways of representing thought (Mohammed, Klimoski \& Rentsch, 2001). This book is devoted exclusively to causal mapping. The primary objective ofthis chapter is to provide an historical overview of the use of causal mapping, and its migration from political science to organization theory, and more recently into research efforts in IT. This migration has brought in its wake a diversity of perspectives and approaches, and therefore, a secondary objective of this chapter is to sketch this diversity, so that readers can appreciate the subtle differences among the various users of the tool. Thus, this chapter is meant for those interested in an appreciation of the technique beyond its immediate application. This chapter unfolds in two major sections. In the first section, I detail the migration of the causal mapping technique over five stages, identifying the milestones in its evolu- tion, and the seminal works that punctuate this evolution. In the second, I summarize the diversity Of approaches among users Of causal mapping and, indeed, the discerning reader will notice this diversity in the contributions Of this edited book. Evolution of Causal Mapping The term cognitive maps appeared in a paper written by Edward C. Tolman titled, "Cognitive Maps in Rats and Men," in the Psychological Review in 1948. Although he did not use the term in the sense known in organization sciences, Tolman extolled the virtues of reason, which were in contrast to the behavioral psychologist's view which focused on stimulus response mechanisms for explaining human behavior. The term was later used by Axelrod to name the methods he and his colleagues employed to represent the arguments ofpolitical elites. The term, "cognitive maps," however, conveyed the idea that the maps represented the actual workings of the mind. TO avoid the claim that they were representing thought scholars following Axelrod began to employ the term "causal mapping." These scholars claimed that they focused only on causal assertions in a specific set of texts. In addition to the evolution Of the terminology, several streams Of scholarship have contributed to the initial use ofcausal mapping as a tool for representing thought. These streams are varied and Often not related to each other. Nonetheless, it is useful to reflect on this rich heritage, if only to discover opportunities that have not yet been exploited in the contemporary applications Of this tool. I discuss this evolution in five sections: (1 ) EQly Precursors; (2) Immediate Precursors; (3) Axelrod's Seminal Work; (4) Causal Mapping in Organizational Sciences; and (5) Causal Mapping in IS. This is schematically presented in Figure l. Early Precursors By early precursors, I refer to the streams of thought that are closely related to causal mapping, although they may not have been the sources of the original formulation of the tooL Although it is almost impossible to sketch all [H)ssible precursors, at least two distinct streams of thought have close affinity to the original causal mapping technique: structure of arguments, and industrial dynamics. Structure of arguments. The idea that arguments can be represented has been well established in the philosophy of science for a quite a long time. A specific example was provided by Toulmin ( 1958): His analysis scheme is complex as it embraced a broader set of foci than the ones we find in contemporary causal mapping. The scheme responded directly to the need for a methodology that systematically probes the content, logic, and reasonableness of an argument, irrespective of the discipline or context and intent of the argument. The Toulmin framework was intended to achieve three purposes: l) 2) 3) to enable the elements (and thus the structure) Of any "argument" to be captured and delineated; to allow any individual (whether the argument purveyor, opponent, or interested third party) to assess the quality of reasoning at the heart of the argument; and to facilitate the comparison and assessment of two or more arguments, that is, to identify differences among arguments and to determine what these differences mean to both the reasoning and the outcomes.},

Reviewing the literature from 1993 (two years prior to Walsh's review of managerial and organizational cognition) until 2007, this article identifies three elements of SC structure (organizational identity, strategy frames, and organizational routines) and four SC processes (strategy formulation, strategy implementation, strategic change, and organizational learning). The literature portrays strategy formulation as a complex activity consisting of scanning, sensemaking, and decision making. Strategy implementation is composed of sensegiving, sensemaking, and issue selling. This review identifies five streams of empirical research with three well-developed themes (the antecedents and outcomes of strategy frames, determinants and consequences of strategy formulation, and cognitive construction of competitive/industry dynamics) and two emerging themes (the determinants and consequences of strategy implementation and the antecedents and outcomes of organizational identity). This review identifies several opportunities to extend the literature and outlines key methodological implications. Finally, the review addresses the need to build linkages to the ongoing theoretical conversations within strategic management literature. \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2011.},

The phenomenology, clinical symptoms, clinical needs, and risk factors associated with loss by traumatic means and the combined influences of loss and trauma exposure are yet to be systematically studied. We review the complex interplay between trauma and loss by traumatic means. The distinctions between normal and traumatic loss, and complicated and traumatic grief, are contrasted with the traditional conceptualization of posttraumatic stress disorder. The role of various mediators such as concurrent or life-span trauma exposure and interpersonal factors, particularly the degree of attachment to the individual or group traumatically lost, is discussed. We offer a more integrated and focused view of traumatic grief, its predictors, and future directions for the integrative study of trauma and loss outcomes.

In multivariate analyses, CG was associated with female gender, loss of a child, death of deceased at the World Trade Center, and live exposure to coverage of the attacks on television. Posttraumatic stress disorder, major depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and increase in post-9/11 smoking were common among participants with CG.

The prevalence rate of tsunami-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (ignoring the time criterion) ranged between 14\% and 39\% and an additional 5\% to 8\% had PTSD unrelated to the tsunami. The PTSD symptoms were explained by the severity of the trauma exposure and family loss, as well as previous traumatic events. The results confirm the relevance of the individual history of traumatic events for the genesis of PTSD and indicate a high need of mental health assistance among the tsunami-affected children in Sri Lanka.},

While digital data collection facilitates faster and more reliable analysis, existing data collection tools are not optimized for unstructured qualitative (textual) data and peer-to-peer participant collaboration. In this paper, we propose a system called the Development Collaborative Assessment and Feedback Engine version 1.0 (DevCAFE), a customizable participatory assessment platform that collects and integrates quantitative assessment, qualitative feedback and peer-to-peer collaborative filtering. DevCAFE incorporates a library of statistical analyses for researchers to quickly identify quantitative and qualitative trends while collecting field data. DevCAFE can run on any mobile device with a web-browser and can work with or without Internet connectivity. We present results from two pilot projects: (1) 137 participants evaluating family planning education trainings at three Nutrition Education Centers in rural Uganda, and (2) 4,518 participants evaluating policy priorities for elected leaders in the June 2015 Mexico mid-term elections. DevCAFE collected over 19,000 peer-to-peer ratings of 336 submitted ideas. Feedback gathered through DevCAFE enabled targeted reforms to the family planning efforts in Uganda and the need for increased government attention to public safety in Mexico.

"bstract Communities have the potential to function effectively and adapt successfully in the aftermath of disasters. Drawing upon literatures in several disciplines, we present a theory of resilience that encompasses contemporary understandings of stress, adaptation, wellness, and resource dynamics. Community resilience is a process linking a network of adaptive capacities (resources with dynamic attributes) to adaptation after a disturbance or adversity. Community adaptation is manifest in population wellness, defined as high and non-disparate levels of mental and behavioral health, functioning, and quality of life. Community resilience emerges from four primary sets of adaptive capacities\textemdash Economic Development, Social Capital, Information and Communication, and Community F. H. Norris  S. P.

"bstract Communities have the potential to function effectively and adapt successfully in the aftermath of disasters. Drawing upon literatures in several disciplines, we present a theory of resilience that encompasses contemporary understandings of stress, adaptation, wellness, and resource dynamics. Community resilience is a process linking a network of adaptive capacities (resources with dynamic attributes) to adaptation after a disturbance or adversity. Community adaptation is manifest in population wellness, defined as high and non-disparate levels of mental and behavioral health, functioning, and quality of life. Community resilience emerges from four primary sets of adaptive capacities\textemdash Economic Development, Social Capital, Information and Communication, and Community F. H. Norris S. P.

Drawing upon literatures in several disciplines, we present a theory of resilience that encompasses contemporary understandings of stress, adaptation, wellness, and resource dynamics. Community resilience is a process linking a network of adaptive capacities (resources with dynamic attributes) to adaptation after a disturbance or adversity. Community adaptation is manifest in population wellness, defined as high and non-disparate levels of mental and behavioral health, functioning, and quality of life.

A 4-factor measurement model that represented the accepted multicriterion conceptualization of PTSD fit the data of the U.S. and Mexican samples equally well. The 4 factors of Intrusion, Avoidance, Numbing, and Arousal correlated significantly and equivalently with severity of trauma in each sample. A single construct explained much of the covariance of the symptom factors in each sample. However, modeling PTSD as a unidimensional construct masked differences between samples in symptom severity. With severity of trauma controlled, the Mexican sample was higher in Intrusion and Avoidance, whereas the U.S. sample was higher in Arousal. The results suggest that PTSD is a meaningful construct to study in Latin American societies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2008 APA, all rights reserved)}

The reports were examined to find evidence of five key elements of evaluative reasoning, namely, evaluative objectives or questions, criteria or other comparator(s), defined standards, a warranted argument, and an evaluative conclusion or judgement. Only eight of the evaluation reports had evidence of all five ele- ments. While the focus of the meta-evaluation was on the presence of the five elements (not their quality) and the report sample is not representative, the study provides an interesting snapshot of evalu- ative practice in Aotearoa New Zealand. The findings suggest there may be scope to improve evaluative reasoning practice.},

About 50\% of Liberia's reported cases have been in Montserrado County (population 1.5 million), the most populous county, which contains the capital city, Monrovia. To examine the course of the Ebola epidemic in Montserrado County, data on Ebola treatment unit (ETU) admissions, laboratory testing of patient blood samples, and collection of dead bodies were analyzed. Each of the three data sources indicated consistent declines of 53\%-73\% following a peak incidence in mid-September. The declines in ETU admissions, percentage of patients with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results positive for Ebola, and dead bodies are the first evidence of reduction in disease after implementation of multiple prevention and response measures. The possible contributions of these interventions to the decline is not yet fully understood or corroborated. A reduction in cases suggests some progress; however, eliminating Ebola transmission is the critical goal and will require greatly intensified efforts for complete, high-quality surveillance to direct and drive the rapid intervention, tracking, and response efforts that remain essential.},

Ordinary Bosnians are willing to consider cross-ethnic friendships and cooperation. The gap between ethnic elites and entrepreneurs and their constituents is evident still in Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH). The optimistic note of this study is sounded by the fact that half of respondents in BiH want more friends from different nationalities. The differences between the three ethnic groups are not dramatic. However, 41 percent of respondents stated that all or most of their friends were from their own nationality. Analysis of the responses by geographic location and by explanations related to modernization, ethnic competition and war experiences, indicated that all proved useful in understanding the distributions. The geographic distributions indicated the primacy of the urban\textemdash rural factor for questions on current friendship networks and preferences for friends in other ethnic groups.}

Data were derived from a study of the mental health consequences of community violence in both Spanish speakers (n = 102) and English speakers (n = 284). Results of differential item functioning (DIF) analyses revealed that the 2 versions were not fully equivalent on an item-by-item basis in that 6 of the 17 items displayed uniform DIF. No bias was observed, however, at the level of the composite PCL-C scale score, indicating that the 2 language versions can be combined for scale-level analyses.

From an evaluation standpoint, the law created the opportunity for a ``natural'' experiment, specifically, an interrupted time series quasi-experiment. Through the availability of person-level data on an entire state population, the present study combines the design tradition of interrupted time series with the analytic tradition of growth curve modeling to create an ``enriched'' interrupted time series with greater flexibility and explanatory power than the standard design based on aggregate data. Additional techniques from the contemporary evaluation toolkit include: use of propensity scoring for matching and covariance adjustment, multilevel modeling, alternate estimates of the counter-factual, and sensitivity analyses to empirically test the plausibility of validity threats. The study assesses the net impact of the law on labor force participation and criminal behavior among former DA\&A recipients in Washington State, using person-level data on employment and arrests from 2 years before implementation to 3 years after. Hypothesis tests showed unambiguously that the law increased employment but did not increase arrests. Post hoc exploratory analyses\textemdash framed by Mark et al. [Mark, M. M., Henry, G.

The combination of a priori and post hoc analyses confirmed that, as a result of the law, there were fewer DA\&As on public supports, more DA\&As in the workforce, and no evidence of more criminals menacing the public. Analyses also confirmed that a segment of the population, already poor, was made destitute.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Trafficking in women is a widespread human rights violation commonly associated with poor mental health. Yet, to date, no studies have used psychiatric diagnostic assessment to identify common forms of mental distress among survivors returning to their home country. METHODS:A longitudinal study was conducted of women aged 18 and over who returned to Moldova between December 2007 and December 2008 registered by the International Organisation for Migration as a survivor of human trafficking. Psychiatric diagnoses in women at a mean of 6 months after return (range 2-12 months) were made by a trained Moldavian psychiatrist using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, and compared with diagnoses recorded in the same women within 5 days of return. We described the socio-demographic characteristics of the women in the sample including both pre and post-trafficking information. We then described the distribution of mental health diagnoses recorded during the crisis intervention phase (1-5 days after return) and the re-integration phase (2-12 months after return). We compared diagnoses at the patient level between the two time points by tabulating the diagnoses and carrying out a kappa test of agreement and the Stuart-Maxwell test for marginal homogeneity (an extension of the McNemar test to kxk table).RESULTS:120/176 (68\%) eligible women participated. At 2-12 months after their return, 54\% met criteria for at least one psychiatric diagnoses comprising post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) alone (16\%); co-morbid PTSD (20\%); other anxiety or mood disorder (18\%). 85\% of women who had been diagnosed in the crisis phase with co-morbid PTSD or with another anxiety or mood disorder sustained a diagnosis of any psychiatric disorder when followed up during rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS:Trafficked women returning to their country of origin are likely to suffer serious psychological distress that may endure well beyond the time they return. Women found to have co-morbid PTSD or other forms of anxiety and depression immediately post-return should be offered evidenced-based mental health treatment for at least the standard 12-month period of rehabilitation.}

A review of 2,647 studies of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) yielded 476 potential candidates for a meta-analysis of predictors of PTSD or of its symptoms. From these, 68 studies met criteria for inclusion in a meta-analysis of 7 predictors: (a) prior trauma, (b) prior psychological adjustment, (c) family history of psychopathology, (d) perceived life threat during the trauma, (e) posttrauma social support, (f) peritraumatic emotional responses, and (g) peritraumatic dissociation. All yielded significant effect sizes, with family history, prior trauma, and prior adjustment the smallest (weighted r = .17) and peritraumatic dissociation the largest (weighted r = .35). The results suggest that peritraumatic psychological processes, not prior characteristics, are the strongest predictors of PTSD. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2008 APA, all rights reserved)}

  abstract = {Qualitative comparative analysis was initially time-agnostic, but efforts to make the method more time-sensitive have been made since the mid-2000s. These attempts mainly focus on cross-case differences, accounting for change over time at the level of attributes or conditions. While useful, they cannot account for the fact that individual cases also develop over time. As such, strategies regarding `within-case' development have remained under-theorized in qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). To address this gap, we propose trajectory-based qualitative comparative analysis (TJ-QCA) building on the logic of the diversity-oriented approach: meaningful within-case change is carefully defined in terms of development stages that capture qualitative case-based change patterns. We conceptualize configurations dynamically so that they express different development stages. Theoretically, our method is rooted in a complexity-informed understanding of cases describing trajectories through the property space. Trajectory-based qualitative comparative analysis works with both numerical and qualitative data. We will illustrate the method empirically by re-elaborating a well-known published time-sensitive qualitative comparative analysis study.},

Policy initiatives are consistent with this message. We analysed longitudinal evidence from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) to test this theory. Our analysis found that volunteering has a significant, but weak, effect on employability in terms of entry into work. The frequency of volunteering, however, makes a difference to its effects on employment outcomes. The effects also vary according to demographics. The evidence on job retention is weaker, and volunteering appears to have zero or even negative effects on wage progression. While the BHPS has limitations for this kind of analysis, we suggest that too much has been made of the link between volunteering and employability, and indeed that intention is infrequent among volunteers.},

To assess the effectiveness of containment strategies, we developed a stochastic model of Ebola transmission between and within the general community, hospitals, and funerals, calibrated to incidence data from Liberia. We find that a combined approach of case isolation, contact-tracing with quarantine, and sanitary funeral practices must be implemented with utmost urgency in order to reverse the growth of the outbreak. As of 19 September, under status quo, our model predicts that the epidemic will continue to spread, generating a predicted 224 (134 to 358) daily cases by 1 December, 280 (184 to 441) by 15 December, and 348 (249 to 545) by 30 December.},

Previous research regarding both meaning making processes and meanings made as determinants of adjustment has shown inconsistent effects, partly because of the lack of clearly articulated theoretical frameworks and problematic research strategies. In a 1-year longitudinal study, the authors distinguished the meaning making process from the outcomes of that process (meanings made), employing specific measures of both. The authors tested pathways through which meaning making efforts led to 3 different meanings made (growth, life meaning, and restored just-world belief) in a sample of 172 young to middle-age adult cancer survivors, and they explored whether those meanings made mediated the effect of meaning making efforts on psychological adjustment. Cross-sectional and longitudinal path models of the meaning making process indicate that meaning making efforts are related to better adjustment through the successful creation of adaptive meanings made from the cancer experience. The authors conclude with clinical implications and suggestions for future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2008 APA, all rights reserved)}

In this article, we consider the challenges that can emerge during a QCA evaluation by drawing on our experience of conducting one in the field of development cooperation. For each stage of the evaluation process, we systematically discuss the challenges we encountered and suggest solutions on how these can be addressed. We believe that sharing this kind of lessons learned can help evaluators become more familiar with QCA, shedding light on what it is to be expected when considering the application of QCA for an evaluation, at the same time reducing unfounded fears and promoting awareness of traps and requirements. The article can be insightful and potentially inspirational for both commissioners and evaluators.},

  abstract = {This article describes the development and use of a rapid evaluation approach to meet program accountability and learning requirements in a research for development program operating in five developing countries. The method identifies clusters of outcomes, both expected and unexpected, happening within areas of change. In a workshop, change agents describe the causal connections within outcome clusters to identify outcome trajectories for subsequent verification. Comparing verified outcome trajectories with existing program theory allows program staff to question underlying causal premises and adapt accordingly. The method can be used for one-off evaluations that seek to understand whether, how, and why program interventions are working. Repeated cycles of outcome evidencing can build a case for program contribution over time that can be evaluated as part of any future impact assessment of the program or parts of it. Many programs that set out to make a difference to people's lives are increasingly being understood as complex interventions in complex systems (Pawson, 2013). Complexity science provides a range of insights into how change happens, including the idea of emergence and positive feedback loops. Taking these insights onboard means program staff must necessarily grapple with uncertainty as to the nature, size, and pathways to intended program impact (Douthwaite, Kuby, van de Fliert, \& Schulz, 2003; Patton, 2011), which can be problematic when donors require reassurance about the likely returns on their investments. This is particularly so for agricultural research for development programs, which are adaptive research programs in which researchers are expected to specify and implement according to program theory linking their research to uptake and impact (},

  abstract = {The topic of this lecture is causality \textendash{} namely, our awareness of what causes what in the world and why it matters. Though it is basic to human thought, causality is a notion shrouded in mystery, con-troversy, and caution, because scientists and philosophers have had difficulties defining when one event truly causes another. We all understand that the rooster's crow does not cause the sun to rise, but even this simple fact cannot easily be translated into a mathematical equation. Today, I would like to share with you a set of ideas which I have found very useful in studying phenomena of this kind. These ideas have led to practical tools that I hope you will find useful on your next encounter with cause and effect. It is hard to imagine anyone here who is not dealing with cause and effect. Whether you are evaluating the impact of bilin-gual education programs or running an experiment on how mice distinguish food from danger or spec-ulating about why Julius Caesar crossed the Rubi-con or diagnosing a patient or predicting who will win the presidential election, you are dealing with a tangled web of cause\textendash effect considerations. The story that I am about to tell is aimed at helping researchers deal with the complexities of such considerations, and to clarify their meaning. This lecture is divided into three parts. I begin with a brief historical sketch of the difficulties that various disciplines have had with causation. Next I outline the ideas that reduce or elimi-nate several of these historical difficulties.},

  pages = {1--4},
  abstract = {Participatory Systems Mapping is a participatory modelling methodology in which a group of stakeholders collaboratively develop a simple causal map of an issue during the course of a workshop. Stakeholders produce a map made up of factors, which can represent anything as along as they are expressed as a variable (i.e. can in some sense go up and down) and connections which represent causal relationships. The map is intended to represent what stakeholders believe to be the causal structure of their system. The map can be built using a white-board or simple pen and paper materials on a large table. The process of building a map can be hugely valuable to participants, the digitized version of the map can be a useful resource, and additional analysis can be conducted on the map created. Why use Participatory Systems Mapping? These types of models provide thinking tools which can be used for discussion and exploration of complex issues, as well as sense checking the implications of suggested causal links. Such "hands on" complexity science can increase stakeholder motivation and understanding of the scope of whole systems approaches. The diagram above is an example map. We can see the factors in the system represented by the rectangles, and the connections between them by arrows denoting the strength, direction, and nature (positive or negative) of the casual influence. The following eleven steps give a detailed breakdown of how to generate your own Participatory Systems Map (PSM). They are written so that you can use pen, paper, and post-it notes. 11 Steps in creating Participatory Systems Maps in a workshop setting: 1. Pick a focal problem 2. Gather knowledge 3. Pick a focal factor 4. Brainstorm factors 5. Consolidate factors 6. Connecting factors 7. Check the connections 8. Collect factor \& link info 9. Map analysis 10. Verification 11. Scenarios},

A one-week test-retest reliability (n = 54) analysis provided evidence of temporal stability. Adjusted item-to-scale reliability estimates were less supportive. Confirmatory factor analysis using LISREL indicates a three factor structure best represents the SIES-R's underlying factor structure. Results suggest the SIES-R as appropriate for screening of post-trauma symptoms in Sinhala speaking SriLankans in an urban area. ER -},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Few studies have focused on the natural course of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and its determinants in samples of the general population. The authors examined determinants of remission and chronicity of PTSD and associations with other disorders in a prospective community sample. METHOD: The data were drawn from a prospective, longitudinal epidemiological study of adolescents and young adults (age 14-24 years) in Munich, Germany (N=2,548). The course of PTSD from baseline to follow-up 34-50 months later was studied in 125 respondents with DSM-IV PTSD or subthreshold PTSD at baseline. RESULTS: Although 52\% of the PTSD cases remitted during the follow-up period, 48\% showed no significant remission of PTSD symptoms. Respondents with a chronic course were more likely to experience new traumatic event(s) during follow-up (odds ratio=5.21, 95\% confidence interval [CI]=1.95-13.92), to have higher rates of avoidant symptoms at baseline (odds ratio=10.16, 95\% CI=1.73-59.51), and to report more help seeking (odds ratio=5.50, 95\% CI=1.04-29.05), compared to respondents with remission. Rates of incident somatoform disorder (odds ratio=4.24, 95\% CI=1.60-11.19) and other anxiety disorders (odds ratio=4.07, 95\% CI=1.15-14.37) were also significantly associated with a chronic course. CONCLUSIONS: PTSD is often a persistent and chronic disorder. Specific symptom clusters--especially avoidant symptoms--might be associated with the course of PTSD. In addition, the occurrence of new traumatic events differentiates PTSD cases with a chronic course from those with remission.}

  abstract = {Objective: This study compared the prevalence and risk factors of current probable posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) across different occupations involved in rescue/recovery work at the World Trade Center site. Method: Rescue and recovery workers enrolled in the World Trade Center Health Registry who reported working at the World Trade Center site (N=28,962) were included in the analysis. Interviews conducted 2-3 years after the disaster included assessments of demographic characteristics, within-disaster and work experiences related to the World Trade Center, and current probable PTSD. Results: The overall prevalence of PTSD among rescue/recovery workers was 12.4\%, ranging from 6.2\% for police to 21.2\% for unaffiliated volunteers. After adjustments, the greatest risk of developing PTSD was seen among construction/engineering workers, sanitation workers, and unaffiliated volunteers. Earlier start date and longer duration of time worked at the World Trade Center site were significant risk factors for current probable PTSD for all occupations except police, and the association between duration of time worked and current probable PTSD was strongest for those who started earlier. The prevalence of PTSD was significantly higher among those who performed tasks not common for their occupation. Conclusions: Workers and volunteers in occupations least likely to have had prior disaster training or experience were at greatest risk of PTSD. Disaster preparedness training and shift rotations to enable shorter duration of service at the site may reduce PTSD among workers and volunteers in future disasters.

A strong association was found between posttraumatic stress symptoms and grief. The relationship between grief and difficulty functioning was stronger at higher levels of posttraumatic stress than at lower levels. The results support the construct of traumatic grief and have important implications for the treatment of people exposed to large-scale traumatic events and for the training of mental health professionals.

Network graphs are created from codes applied to a transcript or audio file using the code names and their chronological location. The resulting network is a representation of the coding data that characterizes the interrelations of codes. This approach enables quantification of qualitative codes using network analysis and facilitates examination of associations of network indices with other quantitative variables using common statistical procedures. Here, as a proof of concept, we applied this method to a set of interview transcripts that had been coded in 2 different ways and the resultant network graphs were examined. The creation of network graphs allows researchers an opportunity to view and share their qualitative data in an innovative way that may provide new insights and enhance transparency of the analytical process by which they reach their conclusions.},

The authors identified predictors of PTSD symptom severity that distinguished Hispanic police officers (n= 189) from their non-Hispanic Caucasian (n= 317) and Black (n= 162) counterparts and modeled them to explain the elevated Hispanic risk for PTSD. The authors found that greater peritraumatic dissociation, greater wishful thinking and self-blame coping, lower social support, and greater perceived racism were important variables in explaining the elevated PTSD symptoms among Hispanics. Results are discussed in the context of Hispanic culture and may be important for prevention of mental illness in the fastest growing ethnic group in the United States.

I argue with Pawson's interpretation of critical realism's positions on both natural and social science and his charges concerning its totalizing ontology, its arrogant epistemology and its naive methodology. The differences between critical realism and realist evaluation are not as significant as Pawson contends. The main differences between the two realisms lie in their approaches to the relationship between social structures and human agency, and between facts and values. I argue that evaluation scientists need to clearly distinguish structure and agency. They should also make their values explicit. The uncritical approach of realist evaluation, combined with its underplaying of the importance of agency, leaves it open to implication in the abuses of bureaucratic instrumentalism.},

The psychometric properties of the instrument were assessed using Cronbach's alpha and principal components analysis, and its construct validity was assessed via Spearman correlation coefficients with the other instruments.RESULTS:The PTDS and its subscales demonstrated high internal consistency. The principal components revealed by an exploratory analysis are broadly consistent with the DSM-IV subscales except that they reproduce some previously reported difficulties with the "numbing" items from the avoidance subscale. The construct validity of the PTDS was supported by appropriate correlations with other relevant measures of trauma related psychopathology.CONCLUSION:The Bosnian version of the PTDS thus appears to be a time-economic and psychometrically sound measure for screening and assessing current PTSD.

Forms of participation in \{BiH\} schools do not extend to parental influence over education or the running of the school but does include organisation of events, renovating buildings etc. Many schools have quite frequent, but limited, one-way contact with parents. Attendance at meetings is relatively good overall. However there are some groups of parents who attend much less frequently. Parents participate more in bigger schools who consider themselves to be relatively well resourced and in which the principal is convinced of the value of participation. When principals are convinced of the value of participation, they make more effort to encourage it and it is indeed more successful.},

Ethno-political frustration is conceived of as psychological frustration which has ethno-political issues as its content or is attributed to such issues. Ethno-political identity is a complex of many different psychological factors forming part of an individual's self-concept and which derives from knowledge of often multiple social group membership(s) and the emotional response to those membership(s). Especially in Bosnia-Herzegovina, this identity may be complex and may involve both ethnic and geographical-political affiliation(s). Ethno-political identity stage is a construct based on Erikson's conceptualisation of identity development. A ``model of ethno-political frustration and identity'' is presented. It is hypothesised: that ethno-political frustration mediates the effect of objective ethno-political stress on symptoms; and that ethno-political identity stage moderates the effect of objective ethno-political stress on frustration, i.e., those who have a more reflected and robust identity are less affected by ethno-political stress. Results of a survey of students of different faculties in Sarajevo are presented which serve to test the hypotheses.}

  abstract = {Many people go missing during war and acts of terrorism. Do their families suffer an additional or different kind of mental health burden than families of people who are known to have been killed? Two groups of respondents, each comprising 56 women living in Bosnia and Herzegovina, were included in the study. These were women whose husbands were either confirmed as having been killed during the 1992-1995 war or who were at the time of the study officially still listed as missing as a result of the war. These two groups filled in questionnaires on war events, postwar stressors, and mental health status. The results showed that the group with unconfirmed losses had higher levels of traumatic grief (measured on a version of the UCLA Grief Inventory) as well as severe depression (measured on the General Health Questionnaire), even when traumatic events and stressors were controlled for. This study represents one of the first empirical confirmations that, at least in a war context, suffering the unconfirmed loss of a family member has specific negative mental health consequences compared to suffering a confirmed loss. In particular the high levels of severe depression including suicidal ideation in this group give cause for concern. -\dbend{} 2010 Hogrefe Publishing},

  abstract = {In the middle of the 1992-5 war, Willi Butollo visited Bosnia \$\textbackslash backslash\$\& Herzegovina (B\$\textbackslash backslash\$\&H) in the effort to support local psychotherapists and counsellors who were working there. This was the beginning of a relationship between Willi's Lehrstuhl in Munich and the various Departments of Psychology in former Yugoslavia, a relationship which blossomed for the best part of ten years across several countries. The fruit of that intervention and that relationship are still with us. In this contribution I would like firstly to give a brief overview of some of these cooperation and research activities. In the second part of this contribution I will then present one interesting but previously unpublished result from the research conducted during that decade. This comes from a strand of investigation which we had begun in order to complement the more classical approach to research on post-traumatic stress disorder (\{PTSD\}) which we had adopted in the published papers, which is more focused on problems associated with the post-war situation and which puts those published results in a different perspective. The concept in question we named ``ethno-political distress''. It covers aspects of the post-war situation which we believe to make a contribution to mental health and distress but which have not to date received sufficient attention. So the title of this contribution, ``postwar developments'', refers both to the development of clinical psychology in the countries of former Yugoslavia to which we tried to contribute, and to some problematic aspects of post-war development at the individual level.},

  abstract = {a) The research carried out Eight different samples of citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina were assessed in 1998 and 1999, two to four years after the end of the 1992-5 war, covering a wide range of variables including traumatic and stressful experiences and various measures of psychosocial adaptation including \{PTSD\}. b) Main results and conclusion The results were published in nine papers which are described in this Context Statement, and which are also included as Appendices. Taken together, the specific (and sometimes tragic) features of the conflict in B\$\textbackslash backslash\$\&H, and some strengths of the research design, enabled the papers to make a significant contribution to three key psychological themes. The first theme was \{PTSD\} concept and measurement. The psychometric performance of mea- sures of \{PTSD\} in B\$\textbackslash backslash\$\&H were found to be similar to other published results, suggesting that the construct is as valid for the B\$\textbackslash backslash\$\&H population as for the comparison populations on which the instrument was developed. The case is also made for dropping Criterion A from the \{DSM\} \{PTSD\} diagnosis altogether, on the grounds of overwhelming practical and conceptual problems with assessing it using populations with multiple stressors. The second theme was epidemiology and aetiology of \{PTSD\} and other symptom groups. Quite apart from \{PTSD\}, the war had a very significant impact on general mental health across the population. Current \{PTSD\} prevalences in the non-treatment samples ranged from 11\$\textbackslash backslash\$\% amongst returned refugees to 36\$\textbackslash backslash\$\% amongst internally displaced persons (\{IDPs\}) in camps, which are in line with the literature. Beyond \{PTSD\}, impact was concentrated in particularly high levels of somatisation, paranoid ideation, and aggression. \{PTSD\} prevalences amongst returned refugees are clearly lower than those of their peers who stayed in host countries, and much lower than all known reports in refugee samples abroad. Analysis of persons in treatment suggests that those who seek treatment for \{PTSD\} (as opposed to other medical problems) do have high levels of \{PTSD\} symptoms speci{$\dottedsquare$}cally, but not necessarily because they experienced a larger number of traumatic events. The third theme looked beyond psychopathology. Findings suggest that the concept of post- traumatic growth can be validly extended to this population, but levels were considerably lower than reported in most other studies on other kinds of traumatic event. Finally \{PTSD\} and the \{PTSD\} diagnosis are discussed in a broader social context and it is concluded that while the war had many different kinds of consequences beyond the purely clinical, this should not divert attention from the fact that individual, clinically-relevant suffering was prevalent in the population at levels warranting urgent attention from public health care.}

Using a switching regression model with endogenous switching, we find that in the public sector volunteers receive a positive wage premium that does not influence their involvement, while the premium is negative in the private sector. We also find little evidence of the presence of alternative types of returns on the labor market, such as employment mobility or entry into the labor market. Our findings are more consistent with a consumption motive and we suggest that volunteering is carried out with a relational purpose. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {This chapter explores the use of mechanisms within the realist evaluation of the Building Capacity to Use Research Evidence (BCURE) program, a \textbackslash pounds15.7 million initiative aiming to improve the use of evidence in decision-making in low and middle-income countries. The evaluation was commissioned to establish not just whether BCURE worked but also how and why capacity building can contribute to increased use of evidence in policymaking in the very different contexts in which the program operated. This chapter argues that using mechanisms helped provide nuanced and robust insights into these questions, while also strengthening the usefulness and policy relevance of the evaluation. Drawing primarily on qualitative data, including interviews with more than 500 stakeholders over 3 years, the evaluation explored the mechanisms that promote capacities to use evidence in decision-making, through developing and testing realist context-intervention-mechanism-outcome configurations (CIMOs). Uncovering the value of mechanisms for policy and program learning was not easy, and the chapter sets out some of the thorny challenges faced and how the BCURE evaluation navigated these. Ultimately, the use of mechanisms in the BCURE evaluation helped to generate practical and nuanced insights that fed directly into the design of a \textbackslash pounds17 million follow-up program. The seven mechanisms uncovered are continuing to inform our own and others' work on institutional capacity change in a wide range of fields.},

  abstract = {People with cancer often report that they experience personal growth as a result of the disease, but such reports have unclear validity. Some suggest such growth results from Rogers's (1951) hypothesized organismic valuing process (OVP), an innate tendency for people to gravitate toward well-being; others suggest this growth may be a positive illusion resulting from temporal self-comparisons. To test these conceptualizations, the authors examined 83 individuals with Stages 0-III breast or prostate cancer. Patients completed measures of positive attributes and personal life goals before radiotherapy (Time 1) and after radiotherapy (Time 2). At Time 2, participants also attempted to recreate their Time 1 responses and completed a posttraumatic growth (PTG) measure. PTG was significantly related with actual increases (but not perceived increases) in the relative importance of intrinsic goals versus extrinsic goals and with perceived increases (but not actual increases) in positive attributes. These measures were unrelated to one another and thus explained unique variance in PTG. Data suggest that both actual change processes related to the OVP and biases in autobiographic recall may independently contribute to PTG reports.

Agreeing on a course of action can be challenging as stakeholders have different views or `mental models' of how a problem is shaped by many interacting causes. Participatory modeling allows to externalize mental models in forms such as causal maps. Participants can be guided by a trained facilitator (with limitations of costs and availability) or use a free software (with limited guidance). Neither solution easily copes with large causal maps, for instance by preventing redundant concepts. In this paper, we leveraged voice-activated virtual assistants to create causal models at any time, without costs, and by avoiding redundant concepts. Our three case studies demonstrated that our artificial facilitator could create causal maps similar to previous studies. However, it is limited by current technologies to identify concepts when the user speaks (i.e. entities), and its design had to follow pre-specified rules in the absence of sufficient data to generate rules by discriminative machine-learned methods.},

"help participants track relationships, a map building process can be conceptualized as a graph traversal: we want to elicit/visit all of the concepts (i.e. nodes) that pertain to the user's mental model, and we move from a concept to another using a relationship. Unlike a graph exploration in which we typically come back to the first node, the map building process ends on an arbitrary node. Two typical approaches to a graph traversal are a depth-first search (DFS) and a breadth-first search (BFS). Starting from a root, a DFS follows one unexplored node, and from there visits another unexplored node, thus going as far as possible. When it cannot go further, it backtracks until it can branch in a new direction" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EC5YG3P8?page=9}{Reddy et al 2019:119})

"two limitations. First, we used hand-crafted rules, which is more in line with early spoken dialog systems than with current ones. Other approaches use generative methods (e.g., Bayesian networks) which often involve hand-crafted parameters, or discriminative methods where parameters are inferred by machine learning from the data. As stated by Henderson, "discriminative machine-learned methods are now the state-of-the-art in dialog state tracking" [55]. However, machine learning requires data to learn from. There is currently no corpus of model building involving a facilitator and one participant. Such sessions are often conducted with many participants, and the recordings are not released as the consent forms generally include an anonymity clause. Designing a better artificial facilitator will thus start by assembling a large set of recordings between a facilitator and a participant, for instance by modeling a system in which participants would be comfortable in publicly sharing their perspectives. Second, our approach extensively relies on Alexa followed by Google Natural Language API to identify entities. Our prototype struggled with creating causal maps with specialized terms (e.g., from the medical domain) as Alexa could not identify them in speech and/or the API would not see them as relevant entities. The API may improve over time, and it may also be assisted with ontologies to identify (i) which specialized terms may be used, and (ii) which term is likely to be used following another one. Similarly, improvements in the API would reduce the processing time which currently results in many awkward seconds of silence.

Overall sample prevalence of PTSD was 12.3\% lifetime and 4.6\% within the past 6 mo. The rate of PTSD was significantly higher among crime vs noncrime victims (25.8\% vs 9.4\%). History of incidents that included direct threat to life or receipt of injury was a risk factor for PTSD. Findings are compared with data from other epidemiological studies.

But where these ideas of `impact' are coupled with a narrow use of the contingency approach, some less helpful `triangulated' relationships might be evident. These relationships might be regarded in terms of an `iron triangle', a metaphor used frequently to exemplify pernicious relations of power. The most notable expression of the iron triangle is the `military\textendash industrial complex'. This article briefly outlines generic features of the iron triangle in terms of `systemic triangulation' \textendash{} an idea linking three core systems concepts of interrelationships, perspectives and boundaries. Drawing on a tradition of systems thinking in practice, an associated systemic triangulator is introduced as both a diagnostic and planning heuristic; a device for not only diagnosing symptoms of an evaluation\textendash industrial complex but for prompting ideas towards a more benign evaluation\textendash adaptive complex for impact evaluation.},

  abstract = {SODA, SSM, CSH and SD are hardly trendy acronyms; even among practicing managers they won't enjoy widespread recognition. Authors Reynolds and Holwell explain the novel termi-nology points to radical approaches in organisational research: participative ways of interven-ing in complex dilemmas troubled by uncertainty. These approaches are therefore not techniques for solving easily-defined problems but are means for tackling social 'messes'. If social problem X is opaque, awkward to express in words, then the interesting modes of research discussed in this book might be a good idea. The group or advisor troubled by X would choose an approach which seems easy to understand and put to work, perhaps one that can be used again after an itinerant consultancy team has moved on. Yet this line of thought puts a huge burden on the approach architect: to draft principles amenable to multifarious men and women -whatever their histories, ambition and foibles \textendash{} and which also help make sense of fuzzy, never-to-be-repeated organisational dilemmas. Occasionally the writing in SAMC strays too far from lay readers' backgrounds, people who ought to be kept on-board if participation is sought. Although the first chapter shows how research principles have been grouped together by several authors, the categorising can be controversial; for instance, in figure 1.2 the work of Jackson, Ulrich, and Flood points towards a bubble labelled critical systems, while Open University and Checkland points to a very general label of applied systems studies rather than his innovation SSM or the phrase soft systems, an unusual slant. In chapter two Dr John Morecroft describes Systems Dynamics, an approach linked to Jay Forrester's research and The Fifth Discipline of Peter Senge. Examples of mixing hot and cold flows in a shower (with annoying time delays) and the relation between hunger and food give the gist of Systems Dynamics, before complex settings of drug related crime Philosophy of Management (2016) 15:251\textendash 254 and airline marketing. An arrow which links Hunger with Amount Eaten is shown as positive \textendash{} with another counteracting effect (negative) from Amount Eaten to Hunger, thus appetites are balanced. However, it may be that habit, stress or flavourings keep Joe eating well beyond a recommended balance. Another contrary notion is whether an increase in the number of police allocated to drug busting will increase drug seizures (figure 2.19) when wise guys in that trade learn from their mistakes. The mathematical nature of SD \textendash{} including skill in 'writing good algebra' with 'equations that mean what you intend' -appears on computer simulators, putting this programme beyond the budget of many organisations and into the hands of consultants. Even a thousand lines of their expert algebra will capture neither how reality 'actually is' nor tomorrow's insights for change. Patrick Hoverstadt briefs readers on the Virtual System Model in chapter three, reliant on the texts of Stafford Beer and his 'laws of viable organisation'. Deploying five sub-systems and a principle of recursion, Beer's VSM model allows comparisons against real organisations. As examples of system descriptions, S2 is a sub-system of activities which stop different operations causing problems for one another, while S5 is comprised of management activities which ensure the organisation works as a system. Does the generality of S5 make S2 redundant? No methodology is required here, an omission which might puzzle those unfamil-iar with organisational research. One principle is stressed: Only variety can absorb variety. Figure 3.3 (Balancing the complexity equation) shows how an organisation (presumably its executives) reduces variety of the environment into market segments, subsequently reduced by management into divisions which handle complex tasks. Management and the organisation can also amplify their own variety, for instance by 'increasing divisional autonomy'. This so called 'balancing act' might be translated into the modest claim that various groups at various times will do their best to satisfy events and trends, no algebraic dexterity required, and not a simultaneous equation in sight. Chapter four's SODA (Strategic Options and Analysis) by Fran Ackermann and Colin Eden can explore options within tricky situations via a means-ends network, supported where necessary by causal mapping software and based on theories from cognitive psychology and social negotiation. In general, moving from the top to bottom of these networks we first encounter consequences and objectives above a central issue, then, at the diagram's base are constraints and options. Since the authors advise working with multiple perspectives and construe events differently, they may allow doubts about their Process \& Content diagram (Figure 4.2). Instead of aligning Process with 'power, skills and personalities' and Content with 'capturing and analysing data and analysing problem statements' \textendash{} the labels make more sense when flipped: the content of a study would include a note on the power, skills and personalities encountered within the client organisation. With SODA exercises collecting up to sixty statements during forty-five minutes of discussion and the need for the computer-based tool Decision Explorer when models become large, this systems approach is another requiring expert input. Bewitched by language? A simple string of words might trouble newcomers. For instance, figure 4.7 includes three linked phrases,},

Answers also depended on whether the device is deterministic or probabilistic-whether X's causal parents "always" or only "usually" cause X to operate. Participants' explanations of their answers often invoked non-operation of causally prior components or unreliability of prior connections. They less often mentioned independence from these causal elements.},

  abstract = {Background: The 34-year-long, Guatemalan war left at least 1,841 persons disabled in the country. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of mental disorders in individuals who acquired their disability as a result of the war, and to identify probable risk factors. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted of a group of 99 civilians with a disability in Guatemala. Participants were selected from four civilian organizations serving disabled persons in the municipality of Nebaj, Quiche. The diagnostic instrument was the computerized version of the Composite International Diagnostic Instrument 2.1 (CIDI 2.1). Data were collected from 2002 to 2004. Results: Of the 99 disabled persons who completed the interview, 44 had some type of lifetime psychiatric disorder. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was the most prevalent, with 34.34\% (34 cases), followed by dysthymia, with 10.10\% (10 cases), and depression, with 6.06\% (6 cases). Conclusion: The traumatic events experienced during the conflict caused long-term psychological sequelae in people who were disabled as a result of the war. Increased exposure to traumatic events, being married, physical disability, illiteracy and advanced age were identified as probable risk factors for mental disorders.

RESULTS No significant differences were found between the number of suicides before and following the disaster or between areas affected and unaffected by the tsunami. CLIICAL IMPLICATIONS Worldwise, the impact of disasters upon suicide rates is variable. It is possible that the tsunami failed to have any profound effect on societal forces affecting suicide rates in Sri Lanka.},

While complexity has been defined in varied ways in previous discussions of evaluation theory and practice, this article draws on Glouberman and Zimmerman's conceptualization of the differences between what is complicated (multiple components) and what is complex (emergent). Complicated programme theory may be used to represent interventions with multiple components, multiple agencies, multiple simultaneous causal strands and/or multiple alternative causal strands. Complex programme theory may be used to represent recursive causality (with reinforcing loops), disproportionate relationships (where at critical levels, a small change can make a big difference \textemdash{} a `tipping point') and emergent outcomes.},

  abstract = {QCA has recently been subject to massive criticism and although the substance of that criticism is not completely new, it differs from earlier critiques by invoking simulations for the evaluation of QCA. In addition to debates about the meaning of the simulation results, there is a more fundamental discussion about whether simulations promise any relevant insights in principle. Some voices in the QCA community reject simulations per se because they necessarily lack case knowledge. As a consequence, the debate is at an impasse on a metalevel because critics of QCA rely on simulations, the results of which some QCA proponents refuse to consider as insightful. This article addresses this impasse and presents six reasons why simulations must be considered appropriate for evaluating QCA. I show that if taken to its conclusion, the central argument against simulations undermines the need for running a truth table analysis in the first place. The way forward in this debate should not be about whether simulations are useful, but how to configure meaningful simulations evaluating QCA.},

A model of causation that describes causes in terms of sufficient causes and their component causes illuminates important principles such as multi-causality, the dependence of the strength of component causes on the prevalence of complementary component causes, and interaction between component causes. Philosophers agree that causal propositions cannot be proved, and find flaws or practical limitations in all philosophies of causal inference. Hence, the role of logic, belief, and observation in evaluating causal propositions is not settled. Causal inference in epidemiology is better viewed as an exercise in measurement of an effect rather than as a criterion-guided process for deciding whether an effect is present or not.},

Observed values of the potential outcomes are revealed by the assignment mechanism?a probabilistic model for the treatment each unit receives as a function of covariates and potential outcomes. Fisher made tremendous contributions to causal inference through his work on the design of randomized experiments, but the potential outcomes perspective applies to other complex experiments and nonrandomized studies as well. As noted by Kempthorne in his 1976 discussion of Savage's Fisher lecture, Fisher never bridged his work on experimental design and his work on parametric modeling, a bridge that appears nearly automatic with an appropriate view of the potential outcomes framework, where the potential outcomes and covariates are given a Bayesian distribution to complete the model specification. Also, this framework crisply separates scientific inference for causal effects and decisions based on such inference, a distinction evident in Fisher's discussion of tests of significance versus tests in an accept/reject framework. But Fisher never used the potential outcomes framework, originally proposed by Neyman in the context of randomized experiments, and as a result he provided generally flawed advice concerning the use of the analysis of covariance to adjust for posttreatment concomitants in randomized trials.},

\par
To assess study-retrieval bias in this meta-analysis, a file-\\
drawer calculation suggested by Rosenthal (1984) was per-\\
formed to estimate the number of unreported studies, averag-\\
ing a null result of p {$<$} .05, that would have to exist before the\\
results of this meta-analysis could reasonably be attributed to\\
sampling bias of study retrieval; this calculation yielded a value\\
of 2,386. Rosenthal (1984) suggested that if the file-drawer\\
value (2,386) is equal to or greater than five times the number of\\
studies in the analysis (5X31 = 155), then the analysis is robust\\
to the file-drawer problem; such was the case with the present\\
review.
\par
Effect sizes were calculated for each t, \textsterling or chi-square test of signifi-\\
cance by using formulas developed by Rosenthal (1984). These result\\
in a Pearson r, which represents the effect size for any given signifi-\\
cance test. This r can be interpreted as any conventional correlation\\
coefficient, and essentially represents the degree of relationship be-\\
tween the two relevant variables of interest for any given study.
\par
The effect-size estimates across all studies and all forms of\\
psychopathology were combined to provide one global esti-\\
mate of the relationship between disasters and psychopathol-\\
ogy. Using procedures outlined by Rosenthal (1984), estimates\\
of r were converted to the Fisher z, weighted for sample size,\\
combined, and converted back to a single estimate of r. This\\
estimate was r =. 174 (n = 31), indicating that a positive relation-\\
ship exists.\\
 At first sight, an effect size equivalent to a correlation coeffi-\\
cient of .174 may appear small. To assess the practical impor-\\
tance of such an effect size, Rosenthal and Rubin (1982) recom-\\
mended use of the binomial effect size display (BESD). For the\\
present research, the BESD provides an answer to the following\\
question: What is the effect of disaster on the prevalence rate of\\
psychopathology? As shown by Rosenthal and Rubin (1982),\\
such an effect would be equal to r X 100 = 17.4\%. Therefore, an\\
effect size of r = . 174 indicates that an increase of approxi-\\
mately 17\% in the prevalence rate of psychopathology},

Course evaluations criticized this concept as insufficiently developed; this article challenges those criticisms. Using the five basic axioms cited by Guba and Lincoln in \{"Epistemological\} and Methodological Bases of Naturalistic Inquiry," the author compares and contrasts an Eastern paradigm of evaluation to the rationalistic and naturalistic paradigms, and offers suggestions for methodological practices that one who subscribes to such a paradigm might follow.

"Modern standards dictate, furthermore, that this information (data, analysis, and production details) be FAIR: findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. This allows readers to use this information to assess an article, conduct a secondary analysis, or teach students and colleagues. To assure this, a consensus has emerged in discussions of transparency that scholars should not house supplementary materials that enhance data, analytic, and production transparency on personal websites but in more stable venues. A range of alternatives exist, including hosting by a journal as supplementary material and depositing the material in a third-party repository." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/35W43YJM?page=3}{ 2020:3})

"Analysts flexibly assign a role, weight, and meaning to each observation, depending on not just its specific position in the underlying narrative but also its plausibility and appropriateness in a particular real-world setting. This nuanced but rigorous process of contextual interpretation (whether it is termed process-tracing, ethnography, narrative history, or textual interpretation) has long been prized in fields such as history, law, and anthropology and is employed in fields such as political science and sociology as well" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/35W43YJM?page=4}{ 2020:4})

"were far more hospitable to rich and rigorous qualitative work than they are today. For centuries, the discursive footnote has been an effective instrument for rendering qualitative scholarship transparent. It typically contains a textual quotation, an interpretation by the author, and a complete citation." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/35W43YJM?page=5}{ 2020:5})
\par
"While journals in a few disciplines continue to permit scholars to publish discursive footnotes, most social sciences have gone in the opposite direction. Recent trends in the format and style of social scientific research favor mathematic analysis instead. For example, almost all journals now use in-text ("scientific") citations, designed for nonqualitative scholarship that cites only other secondary scholarship, or simple citations that sometimes lack detail (e.g., page numbers), almost never include quotations or interpretation and require that any curious reader track down the original source. The decline of standard word limits from 10,000 to 14,000 a few decades ago to 8,000 words (and trending further down) means that such omissions cannot be offset with more extensive discussion in the main text" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/35W43YJM?page=5}{ 2020:5})

"has now become nearly impossible for readers to distinguish rich and subtle case studies that rest on deep and genuine local knowledge, reliable sources, and compelling interpretations from those that are thin, inconclusive, or empirically unpersuasive" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/35W43YJM?page=6}{ 2020:6})

"four disadvantages have led scholars to conclude that archiving data is at best a partial solution appropriate to a thin subset of qualitative research. This is true for four reasons." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/35W43YJM?page=7}{ 2020:7})
\par
"First is lack of analytic transparency. Archiving qualitative data without interpretive analysis tells us little. We do not learn which passage within a source text the author deems essential, how the author interpreted it, or where and how it fits within the main narrative presented in the case study. This undermines a major comparative advantage of qualitative research backed by discursive footnotes" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/35W43YJM?page=7}{ 2020:7})
\par
"The difference lies in a new digital transparency appendix (TRAX) appended to the work\textemdash either by the journal itself or by separate software running alongside the article. AC prescribes that citations to any source backing a "contestable empirical claim" should be hyperlinked to a corresponding entry in the TRAX. Each of these entries contains four elements: 1. a verbatim excerpt from the textual source (if ethical, legal, or logistical limitations require it, a description may be substituted); 2. an annotation explaining how the author interprets the source to support the corresponding claim in the main text; 3. a complete citation; and 4. optionally, a link to or scan of the full source" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/35W43YJM?page=8}{ 2020:8})}

Optimization of the device workspace, dexterity, torque output and size was carried out during the design phase of the device. The development of the system involved the realization of a new customized linear actuator able to meet the speed and force requirements of the device functionality. We also discuss the impedance-based control scheme used for the redundantly actuated device, which allows the execution of both assistive and resistive strengthening rehabilitation regimes. Results from the control of a single linear actuator and further experimental tests including the position tracking of the fully actuated platform are presented. It is believed that the performance and the simplicity of the proposed mechanism will allow the widespread use of the system as a new aid tool for ankle rehabilitation.},

A common question is whether one should use the provided weights to perform weighted least squares when doing regression analysis. Such a course of action may lead to incorrect estimates. If particular groups follow significantly different regression specifications, the preferred method of analysis is to estimate a separate regression for each group or to use indicator variables to specify group membership; regression on a random sample of the population would be misspecified. Users uncertain about the appropriate method should consult an econometrician, statistician, or other person knowledgeable about the data before specifying the regression model.

The proposed implementation starts from standard premise semantics and involves a new 'filtering' operation that achieves just this removal.

The analyses carried out indicated that the economic valuation of forest resources as well as the monitoring of forest cover are key issues for the management of Santa Catarina's native forests. In addition, the information generated by the causal map analysis can assist not only the process of designing innovative and all-inclusive policies for the management of native forests, but also the modeling process based on Systems Dynamics in order to evaluate the impacts of policies on the dynamics that govern the conservation and use of the resources of native forests. The adopted SODA approach also proved to be effective in structuring the complex problem situation addressed in this study.},

Recent innovations in LFA theory and practice have led to a Third Generation of LFA use resulting in its increased effectiveness and practicality as a tool for designing, implementing and evaluating agricultural research projects. Amongst these innovations are: 1) team-based (or participatory) use of the LFA; 2) guidelines for applying the LFA to research projects; 3) LFA software, enabling much more dynamic use of the approach; 4) better integration of the LFA with other project implementation tools; 5) better understanding of practical indicators for project performance and supporting monitoring and evaluation methods and; 6) a better understanding of the critical success factors required for sustainable and effective LFA use within institutions. Lessons are derived from efforts to introduce the Third Generation LFA to the National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA) in Morocco.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               To make effective progress towards a global reduction in obesity prevalence, there needs to be a focus on broader structural factors, beyond individual-level drivers of diet and physical activity. This article describes the use of a systems framework to develop obesity prevention policies with adolescents. The aim of this research was to use the group model building (GMB) method to identify young people's perceptions of the drivers of adolescent obesity in five European countries, as part of the EU-funded Co-Create project.                                         Methods               We used GMB with four groups of 16\textendash 18-year-old in schools in each of the five European countries (The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal and the UK) to create causal loop diagrams (CLDs) representing their perceptions of the drivers of adolescent obesity. The maps were then merged into one, using a new protocol.                                         Results               Two hundred and fifty-seven participants, aged 16\textendash 18 years, engaged in 20 separate system mapping groups, each of which generated 1 CLD. The findings were largely congruent between the countries. Three feedback loops in the merged diagram particularly stand out: commercial drivers of unhealthy diets; mental health and unhealthy diets; social media use, body image and motivation to exercise.                                         Conclusions               GMB provides a novel way of eliciting from young people the system-based drivers of obesity that are relevant to them. Mental health issues, social media use and commercial practices were considered by the young people to be key drivers of adolescent obesity, subjects that have thus far had little or no coverage in research and policy.},

  abstract = {This article develops a new approach for constructing causal maps called the Collective Causal Mapping Methodology (CCMM). This methodology collects information asynchronously from a group of dispersed and diverse subject-matter experts via Web technologies. Through three rounds of data collection, analysis, mapping, and interpretation, CCMM constructs a parsimonious collective causal map. The article illustrates the CCMM by constructing a causal map as a teaching tool for the field of operations management. Causal maps are an essential tool for managers who seek to improve complex systems in the areas of quality, strategy, and information systems. These causal maps are known by many names, including Ishikawa (fishbone) diagrams, cause-and-effect diagrams, impact wheels, issue trees, strategy maps, and risk-assessment mapping tools. Causal maps can be used by managers to focus attention on the root causes of a problem, find critical control points, guide risk management and risk mitigation efforts, formulate and communicate strategy, and teach the fundamental causal relationships in a complex system. Only two basic methods for creating causal maps are available to managers today - brainstorming and interviews. However, these methods are limited, particularly when the subject-matter experts cannot easily meet in the same place at the same time. Managers working with complex systems across large, geographically dispersed organizations can employ the CCMM presented here to efficiently and effectively construct causal maps to facilitate improving their systems. \textcopyright{} 2006, Decision Sciences Institute.},

  abstract = {hat conception of causation is at work in the law? I argue that the law implicitly relies on a contrastive conception. In a liability case where the defendant's breach of duty must be shown to have caused the plaintiff's damages, it is not enough to consider what would have happened if the cause had not occurred\textendash the law instructs us to look to a specific replacement for the cause, which in this case is the hypothetical scenario in which the defendant acted lawfully. And it is not enough to ask if the effect would still have occurred\textendash the law requires us to look to a specific replacement for the effect, which in this case is the hypothetical outcome in which the plaintiff came off better. In place of ``but for the defendant's breach, the plaintiff's damage would not have occurred,'' I suggest the more explicit ``if the defendant had acted lawfully, the plaintiff would have met a better fate.'' An explicitly contrastive approach can thus potentially help the lawyer phrase her causal question in a more explicit way, while shedding light on our conception of causation. According to David Hume, our concepts of causation, resemblance, and contiguity are the foundation of all of our reasoning concerning matters of fact and are ``to us the cement of the universe.''1 Our concept of causation seems crucial to legal thought. Many liability doctrines in both criminal law and torts explicitly require that the defendant has caused harm to the plaintiff.2 Assuming that the law uses our concept of causation and not its own stipulatively defined notion, our concepts of causation and of legal liability may prove mutually illuminating.},

  abstract = {This article focuses on methodological challenges in evaluating complex program aid interventions like budget support. We show that recent innovations in process-tracing methodology can help solve the identified challenges and increase the strength of causal inference made when using case studies in demanding settings. For the specific task of evaluating the governance effectiveness of budget support interventions, we developed a more fine-grained causal mechanism for a sub-set of the comprehensive program theory of budget support. Moreover, based on the informal use of Bayesian logic, we have elaborated on how to increase the conclusiveness of empirical evidence for one part of the theorized causal mechanism. We argue that by establishing an explicit theorized mechanism prior to empirical research and by critically judging our evidence according to an informal Bayesian logic we can remedy some of the problems at hand in much case-study research and increase the inferential leverage in complex within-case evaluation studies.},

However, it is unclear whether the aggregation of effect estimates across heterogeneous populations will be consistent for a meaningful parameter when not all treatments are evaluated on each population. Drawing from counterfactual theory and the causal inference framework, we define the population of interest in a network meta-analysis and define the target parameter under a series of nonparametric structural assumptions. This allows us to determine the requirements for identifiability of this parameter, enabling a description of the conditions under which network meta-analysis is appropriate and when it might mislead decision making. We then adapt several modeling strategies from the causal inference literature to obtain consistent estimation of the intervention-specific mean outcome and model-independent contrasts between treatments. Finally, we perform a reanalysis of a systematic review to compare the efficacy of antibiotics on suspected or confirmed methicillin-resistant \$\textbackslash backslash\$emph\{Staphylococcus aureus\} in hospitalized patients.},

For these zones it may be necessary to take a range of typical years (deficit and surplus) and average them into a "normal" year." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_MHECPC69/51}{Seaman et al 2000:51})

"There are five steps in conducting an HEA analysis. They are:  1. Define the food economy or economies (the group or groups of households) for which an analysis is required.  2. Define categories of household wealth within each food economy." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_MHECPC69/45}{Seaman et al 2000:45})
\par
"3. For each wealth category, collect information that will enable you to describe how, in a ``normal'' or baseline year, a typical household obtains its income and what the economic context is." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_MHECPC69/45}{Seaman et al 2000:45})

"There is often a precise local terminology for wealth categories; it seems to be a universal human instinct to categorise the members of one's community by their wealth." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_MHECPC69/49}{Seaman et al 2000:49})

\par
"In some areas, household income may fluctuate wildly from year to year: for example, in semi-arid zones crop production may be in deficit for four years in ten, meet consumption requirement in three and be in great surplus in three. In these areas it is usual for people to store the surplus and use it to make up the deficit in years of low production. For these zones it may be necessary to take a range of typical years (deficit and surplus) and average them into a ``normal'' year." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_MHECPC69/51}{Seaman et al 2000:51})

Tellegen, D. Watson, \& L. A. Clark's (1999a, 1999b) higher-order dimension of happiness-unhappiness (or demoralization; see A. Tellegen et al., 2003). In Study 1, 502 undergraduate students completed several symptom measures of mood and anxiety disorders and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (J. N. Butcher et al., 2001). Using confirmatory factor analysis, the authors replicated Watson's distress and fear disorder model. Path analyses showed that demoralization was a primary marker of distress disorders, whereas dysfunctional negative emotions was a primary marker of fear disorders. Low positive emotions was a specific marker of depression and social phobia. This 3-factor path model was associated with better fit than was a 2-factor model excluding demoralization. In Study 2, the authors replicated the findings of Study 1 using data from an archival clinical sample of 636 Veterans Affairs hospital outpatients. The authors' findings provide evidence on the important role of demoralization in mood and anxiety disorders. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2008 APA, all rights reserved)}

  abstract = {Traumatic experiences can have a powerful impact on individuals and communities but the relationship between perceptions of beneficial and pathological outcomes are not known. Therefore, this meta-analysis examined both the strength and the linearity of the relationship between symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and perceptions of posttraumatic growth (PTG) as well as identifying the potential moderating roles of trauma type and age. Literature searches of all languages were conducted using the ProQuest, Wiley Interscience, ScienceDirect, Informaworld and Web of Science databases. Linear and quadratic (curvilinear) rs as well as ??s were analysed. Forty-two studies (N=11,469) that examined both PTG and symptoms of PTSD were included in meta-analytic calculations. The combined studies yielded a significant linear relationship between PTG and PTSD symptoms (r=0.315, CI=0.299, 0.331), but also a significantly stronger (as tested by Fisher's transformation) curvilinear relationship (r=0.372, CI. =. 0.353, 0.391). The strength and linearity of these relationships differed according to trauma type and age. The results remind those working with traumatised people that positive and negative post-trauma outcomes can co-occur. A focus only on PTSD symptoms may limit or slow recovery and mask the potential for growth. ?? 2013.},

It focuses on their emotional reactions and coping behavior. Qualitative data, collected by means of semi-open interviews with 10 clinicians, are the main source of information. The position of the clinicians between two statuses, therapist and potential victim, is examined, in reference to its influence on the therapists' state of mind and behavior vis-a-vis their patients. Findings indicate that clinicians stress a humanistic and sensitive approach in their work; however, they find the task of constructing a safe environment for themselves and their patients to be exceptionally difficult. They also tend to minimize use of customary professional social-support techniques. The social-anthropological concept of "liminality," as descriptive of the therapists' state of mind and coping behavior, is employed as a useful analytical tool.}

Three common PTSD scales were administered to 122 undergraduates who had experienced an emotionally salient, nontraumatic event: a college examination. Results indicated that normal levels of anxiety associated with the examination were positively correlated with scores on the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Revised Civilian Mississippi Scale, and PTSD Checklist-CivilianVersion. Multiple regression analyses indicated that substantial variance in the PTSD scales was accounted for by trait characteristics such as negative and positive affectivity and affect intensity (R2 .29 to .53). Negative affectivity correlated as highly with PTSD measures (r = .46 to .71) as those measures correlated with each other (r = .48 to .65). A high proportion of participants exceeded clinical cutoffs on these measures. The findings suggest that these PTSD scales may be overly sensitive to nontraumatic stressors such as everyday distress and trait characteristics.}

While theory is helpful in focusing evaluator's attention and facilitating investigation, it also excludes evidence that does not fit within its framework. The argument is that evaluators need to be aware of all theories that may impinge upon a programme and to defend the theory of choice. They also need to be explicit about what may be excluded from their investigation. Governments aim at change at a macro-level, often using macro-theory, whereas evaluators often concerned with the implementation of programmes may use theory that is at a different, usually the micro-level. Theories at these two levels are not always compatible. The article briefly outlines the development of the theory-driven approach before focusing upon evaluation in health promotion as a case study to highlight the issues.},

Building on a nascent literature, I argue theory diagrams may operate not only conjunctively but also disjunctively, independent from empirics; that their theoretical value lies not only in capturing sociological problems but also in the inferential procedures they embody; that their creative use spans not only deduction and abduction but also induction; that abduction may be pursued with diagrams not only in conjunction with deduction or in the production of visual sketches but also in visual exercises in theoretical play geared primarily toward getting new ideas; and that theory visuals often feature metaphorical aspects that, like their linguistic cousins, transfer thought patterns from one domain to another, thereby providing a major avenue for visual theoretical creativity. Taken together, pursuing these lines of thought helps to build a better understanding of how visualization contributes to the creative intellectual practice of sociological theorizing.},

This article introduces a revised framework for historical analysis that can help systematically capture the deepest causal factors in political development. It improves on the familiar "critical juncture" framework by specifying the precise causal or noncausal status of the "antecedent conditions" preceding critical junctures. After disaggregating antecedent conditions into four logical types, the authors argue that scholars should be especially mindful of critical antecedents: factors or conditions preceding a critical juncture that combine in a causal sequence with factors operating during that juncture to produce divergent outcomes. Through analytic reviews of a wide array of major works, the authors illustrate how critical antecedents can clarify causal claims and enhance knowledge accumulation in comparative politics. \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2010.},

Instead of asking questions about who access extra-curricular activities that may provide young people with positional advantages in the labour market and the class biases that arise in access, the article explores whether the benefits obtained from participation vary by socio-economic background. We make use of the Youth organisations and employability (YOE) database, which contains data from over 1000 young people in more than 40 European countries on the effects of involvement in youth organisations on different forms of capital: human, social and psychological. We find positive effects of involvement on all three forms of capital. The analysis suggests that the characteristics of the involvement in youth organisations are better predictors of its outcomes than are personal characteristics, and find no significant effects of socio-economic background on the reported benefits of participation in our sample. Policy implications are derived from these findings, calling for greater policy support to increase opportunities for the involvement of young people from lower socio-economic backgrounds in youth organisations and for better informing young people of the benefits of sustained involvement with youth organisations.},

  abstract = {Conditionals somehow express conditional beliefs. However, conditional belief is a bi-propositional attitude that is generally not truth-evaluable, in contrast to unconditional belief. Therefore, this article opts for an expressivistic semantics for conditionals, grounds this semantics in the arguably most adequate account of conditional belief, that is, ranking theory, and dismisses probability theory for that purpose, because probabilities cannot represent belief. Various expressive options are then explained in terms of ranking theory, with the intention to set out a general interpretive scheme that is able to account for the most variegated usage of conditionals. The Ramsey test is only the first option. Relevance is another, familiar, but little understood item, which comes in several versions. This article adds a further family of expressive options, which is able to subsume also counterfactuals and causal conditionals, and indicates at the end how this family allows for partial recovery of truth conditions for conditionals.},

Nevertheless, it remains enigmatic and challenging, yet inspiring, to predict the actual interdependencies that comprise the structure of such systems, particularly when the causal interactions observed in real-world phenomena might be persistently hidden. In this article, we propose a robust methodology for detecting the latent and elusive structure of dynamic complex systems. Our treatment utilizes short-term predictions from information embedded in reconstructed state space. In this regard, using a broad class of real-world applications from ecology, neurology, and finance, we explore and are able to demonstrate our method's power and accuracy to reconstruct the fundamental structure of these complex systems, and simultaneously highlight their most fundamental operations.},

A pharmacological prevention approach to this problem has been proposed.

Of 569 accessible, potentially eligible subjects, 48 (8\%) participated. Outcomes assessments were conducted at 1, 4, and 8 months postinjury. Although well tolerated, neither study drug showed a significant benefit over placebo on depressive or posttraumatic stress symptoms. Implications are discussed for future pharmacological prevention studies in survivors of acute traumatic injury. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2008 APA, all rights reserved)}

For this reason, we have adopted the term `ToC approaches' to identify the range of applications associated with this term. Additionally, we identify some confusion in the terminology associated with ToC. Of particular note is the lack of clarity surrounding the use of the terms `assumption' and `evidence'. Finally, we have also drawn out information on what authors feel makes for ToC `best practice' in terms of both content and process, alongside an exploration of the remaining gaps where more clarity is needed.},

Our study unambiguously shows one-way causality between the total Greenhouse Gases and GMTA. Specifically, it is confirmed that the former, especially CO2, are the main causal drivers of the recent warming. A significant but smaller information flow comes from aerosol direct and indirect forcing, and on short time periods, volcanic forcings. In contrast the causality contribution from natural forcings (solar irradiance and volcanic forcing) to the long term trend is not significant. The spatial explicit analysis reveals that the anthropogenic forcing fingerprint is significantly regionally varying in both hemispheres. On paleoclimate time scales, however, the cause-effect direction is reversed: temperature changes cause subsequent CO2/CH4 changes.},

The assumptions underpinning this work, which this paper critiques with particular reference to Bosnia and Rwanda, reflect a globalisation of Western cultural trends towards the medicalisation of distress and the rise of psychological therapies. This paper argues that for the vast majority of survivors posttraumatic stress is a pseudocondition, a reframing of the understandable suffering of war as a technical problem to which short-term technical solutions like counselling are applicable. These concepts aggrandise the Western agencies and their 'experts' who from afar define the condition and bring the cure. There is no evidence that war-affected populations are seeking these imported approaches, which appear to ignore their own traditions, meaning systems, and active priorities. One basic question in humanitarian operations is: whose knowledge is privileged and who has the power to define the problem? What is fundamental is the role of a social world, invariably targeted in today's 'total' war and yet still embodying the collective capacity of survivor populations to mourn, endure and rebuild. Because of copyright reasons I can not publish the entire article here, although I think that it is not correct that Dr. Summerfield does not make this article available on the Internet Since it is essential for the debate, I will however cite here the seven assumptions as Dr. Summerfield  analyses them. It is important that it is understood that Dr. Summerfield criticizes each of these assumptins in a documented way, and I think 'the field' has to respond to these critical remarks in a convincing way before it can move on to impose itself in communities after armed conflict.  With 'a convincing way' I mean that it either  gives arguments to refute Dr. Summerfields remarks, and does so in an open debate with Dr. Summerfield, or, that it adjusts it's assumptions to defendable ones, and remodels the intervention projects accordingly. Seven assumptions behind current psychological trauma programmes:    1. Experiences of war and atrocity are so extreme and distinctive that they do not just cause suffering, they cause 'traumatisation'.    2. There is basically a universal human response to highly stressful events, captured by Western psychological frameworks.    3. Large numbers of victims traumatized by war need professional help.    4. Western psychological approaches are relevant to violent conflict worldwide. Victims do better if they emotionally ventilate and 'work through' their experiences.    5. There are vulnerable groups and individuals who need to be specifically targeted for psychological help.    6. Wars represent a mental health emergency: rapid intervention can prevent the development of serious mental problems, as well as subsequent violence and wars.    7.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:A growing body of literature has demonstrated that higher social capital is associated with improved health conditions. However, some research indicated that the association between social capital and health was substantially attenuated after adjustment for material deprivation. Studies exploring the association between poverty, social capital and health still have some serious limitations. In China, health equity studies focusing on urban poor are scarce. The purpose of this study is therefore to examine how poverty and individual-level social capital in urban China are associated with health equity.METHODS:Our study is based on a household study sample consisting of 1605 participants in two Chinese cities. For all participants, data on personal characteristics, health status, health care utilisation and social capital were collected. Factor analysis was performed to extract social capital factors. Dichotomised social capital factors were used for logistic regression models. A synergy index (if it is above 1, we can know the existence of the co-operative effect) was computed to examine the interaction effect between lack of social capital and poverty.RESULTS:Results indicated the poor had an obviously higher probability of belonging to the low individual-level social capital group in all the five dimensions, with the adjusted odds ratios ranging from 1.42 to 2.12. When the other variables were controlled for in the total sample, neighbourhood cohesion (NC), and reciprocity and social support (RSS) were statistically associated with poor self-rated health (NC: OR = 1.40; RSS: OR = 1.34). However, for the non-poor sub-sample, no social capital variable was a statistically significant predictor. The synergy index between low individual-level NC and poverty, and between low individual-level RSS and poverty were 1.22 and 1.28, respectively, indicating an aggravating effect between them.CONCLUSION:In this study, we have shown that the interaction effect between poverty and lack of social capital (NC and RSS) was a good predictor of poor SRH in urban China. Improving NC and RSS may be helpful in reducing health inequity; however, poverty reduction is more important and therefore should be implemented at the same time. Policies that attempt to improve health equity via social capital, but neglect poverty intervention, would be counter-productive.},

Forty male combat veterans who comprised high and low combat intensity groups were administered a series of measures designed to assess PTSD, depression, anxiety, intrusive thoughts, and avoidance responses. Veterans also completed an emotional Stroop procedure involving combat relevant and non-relevant stimuli. Offspring of veterans (n = 53) completed similar measures. It was found that offspring affective responses were impacted by level of combat intensity. The most pronounced effects occurred on the emotional Stroop wherein children of high combat veterans showed the longest Stroop response latencies. Offspring of veterans were found to be relatively well adjusted despite many of their parent-veterans having PTSD. Results support the Stroop paradigm as a valuable research tool for investigating the parent - child transfer of subtle emotional effects.}

Patterns and associations of wealth and poverty have become more diffuse and diverse as non-farm opportunities have expanded and heightened levels of mobility have led to the delocalization of livelihoods. This, in turn, has had ramifications for the production and reproduction of poverty in the countryside, which is becoming progressively de-linked from agricultural resources. This requires a reconsideration of some old questions regarding how best to achieve pro-poor development in the Rural South.},

  abstract = {Introduction/Background Lower limb trauma can cause kinetic chains impairments that compromise quality of movement and postural stability A pilot study is now being conducted in INAIL Rehabilitation Center of Volterra using Hunova, a robotic system for lower limbs and core stability training and evaluation, to examine whether robot-assisted therapy is effective in motor control and gait performance recovery when compared to conventional rehabilitation programs. Material and method Hunova consists of two mobile platforms for exercising in both seated and upright mono and bipodalic conditions The device can operate in passive, active and assistive mode, detecting compensatory trunk movements with an inertial sensor and giving sensory feedback during exercise. The ongoing open randomized controlled trial foresees the enrolment of fifty-six patients with functional locomotor impairments following work-related injuries of the lower limbs Patients are randomly allocated to experimental or control group and receive a 3 weeks rehabilitation program and a pre- and post-treatment assessment including robotic, clinical and instrumental non-robotic evaluations. All participants undergo an individualized rehabilitation protocol, tailored to specific patient needs and injury characteristics; the experimental group perform instability and resistive training with Hunova; control subjects follow a training program using traditional non-robotic equipment Results Robotic therapy was well tolerated and easy to manage An interim analysis on 37 patients shows that both groups benefited the proposed training protocol and robotic therapy was not inferior to conventional rehabilitation; moreover, patients with distal lower extremity injury show a significantly greater improvement in statistic stability than patients with proximal lower extremity injury. Conclusion Hunova allows to measure significant parameters of static and dynamic stability and can centralize a complex progression of exercises to recover trunk control and reactive balance after traumatic injuries Final results of the study will contribute to explore the rule of robotic therapy in orthopedic conditions.},

  abstract = {Purpose \textendash{} An analysis of the way the bureaucratic management system responded to the Tsunami disaster of December 26, 2004 was repeated in handling of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in the USA at the end of 2005. This research note aims to follow up on the original paper ``Bureaucracy meet catastrophe: analysis of the Tsunami disaster relief efforts and their implications for global emergency governance'', to be published in early 2006. It again highlights the severe shortcomings of the bureaucratic model as a paradigm for responding to situations in which the magnitude of the system's task is overwhelmingly complex and the timing process is bounded by urgency. Design/methodology/approach \textendash{} Evidence of the findings for this research is driven by primary references, namely news reports and web site information provided in the aftermath of the fall 2005 hurricane. Findings \textendash{} Like in the Tsunami disaster, the reports from Hurricane Katrina highlight the key problems of bureaucratic management including slow decision making, inability to absorb and process outside information, and escalation of commitment to failed courses of action. Research limitations/implications \textendash{} Suggestions for future research are provided. Practical implications \textendash{} It is this very requirement (absorbing and processing outside information and escalation of commitment to failed initial courses of action) which may undermine all relief efforts when such a high magnitude event occurs. Originality/value \textendash{} The tragic irony of this analysis is that most emergency relief organizations of the proper size and complexity to effectively deal with ``shocking'' events must work within the bureaucratic systems created by large federal relief organizations (such as FEMA) as the ``price'' for staying in operation.},

Results indicated an oblique 5-factor model best fit the data, thus revealing the PTGI was multidimensional.

Research suggests that OVC programs enhance household- and child-level resilience to economic, environmental, social, or political shocks, but there is little evidence elucidating the pathways by which intervention components, including economic strengthening and social protection programs, affect these outcomes. This case study uses exploratory qualitative research to generate a causal model for the Community Care Program (CCP) in Mozambique. We used the Most Significant Change methodology to compile mini-case studies and identify primary causal pathways between program components and outcomes. We also used the Community Capitals Framework to explore how CCP affected community-level resilience. Our findings suggest that CCP's multi-component approach generated mutually reinforcing drivers that enhanced child-, household-, and community-level resilience. CCP's effects on stigma reduction, increased social support, and economic status were also vital.},

Meta-analyses of studies yielding sex-specific risk of potentially traumatic events (PTEs) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) indicated that female participants were more likely than male participants to meet criteria for PTSD, although they were less likely to experience PTEs. Female participants were more likely than male participants to experience sexual assault and child sexual abuse, but less likely to experience accidents, nonsexual assaults, witnessing death or injury, disaster or fire, and combat or war. Among victims of specific PTEs (excluding sexual assault or abuse), female participants exhibited greater PTSD. Thus, sex differences in risk of exposure to particular types of PTE can only partially account for the differential PTSD risk in male and female participants.

MTurk is a marketplace for discrete tasks completed by workers, typically for small amounts of money. MTurk has been used to aid psychological research in general, and content analysis in particular. In the current study, MTurk workers content analyzed personally-written textual data using coding categories previously developed and validated in psychological research. These codes were evaluated for reliability, accuracy, completion time, and cost. Results indicate that MTurk workers categorized textual data with comparable reliability and accuracy to both previously published studies and expert raters. Further, the coding tasks were performed quickly and cheaply. These data suggest that crowdsourced content analysis can help advance psychological research.},

In the process the author will review the selected literature so that they can be linked together for further consideration and development. When monthly and daily data for S\&P 500, DJIA, and NASDAQ indexes were analyzed from 1971 to 2005, the author found long string of positive and significant autocorrelations and great volatility, which were not consistent with the efficient market hypothesis. The international market indexes from Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Mexico, Taiwan, and Canada are also very volatile even though they show less volatility compared to the U.S. indexes. Since AMH was introduced in 2004, it is promising but is still at its infant stage of development. Finally, the neural/medical finance can help us understand the brain activities when investors are making investing and trading decisions, and the effect of drugs on brain and investment decision-making. The future of neurofinance and AMH appears to be promising.},

  abstract = {Objective: This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessed efficacy and safety of topiramate monotherapy in civilian posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Method: Outpatients (18-64 years) with DSM-IV non-combat-related PTSD and Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) scores {$\pm$} 50 were eligible. Topiramate was started at 25 mg/day and titrated by 25-50 mg/week to 400 mg/day or maximum tolerated dose. Data were collected between April 26, 2002, and February 4, 2004. Primary efficacy, change in total CAPS score, and secondary efficacy measures were assessed by analysis of covariance in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population with last observation carried forward. Results: The ITT population comprised 38 patients with mean {$\pm$} SD baseline total CAPS scores of 88.3 {$\pm$} 13.8 (topiramate, N = 19) and 91.1 {$\pm$} 13.7 (placebo, N = 19). Although a decrease in total CAPS score was noted (topiramate, -52.7; placebo, -42.0), this difference was not statistically significant (p = .232). Topiramate-treated patients exhibited significant reductions in reexperiencing symptoms (CAPS cluster B: topiramate, 74.9\%; placebo, 50.2\%; p = .038) and Treatment Outcome PTSD scale (topiramate, 68.0\%; placebo, 41.6\%; p = .025). Reductions approaching statistical significance, based on a nominal p value, were noted in mean total Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement Scale scores (topiramate, 1.9 {$\pm$} 1.2; placebo, 2.6 {$\pm$} 1.1; p = .055). Conclusion: These preliminary results suggest that further, adequately powered studies of topiramate for the treatment of civilian PTSD are warranted.

Sequential regression analysis was performed with age, gender, tsunami experiences, and family functioning predicting youth behavior problems. In-depth interviews with 40 adolescents revealed many losses and difficulties after the tsunami, including death of parents and school difficulties. Positive aspects of recovery were support from family, peers, and other social networks and increased educational opportunities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved)},

Three of the potential urban disasters which aid workers fear most are earthquakes affecting Tehran, Istanbul or Kathmandu. The report seeks to highlight the lessons learned from good practice and errors made in the response to the Earthquake in Haiti, which took place in the context of widespread poverty and high population density. It said it was particularly important to work closely with local traders, businesses, communities and government following such disasters. It also suggested prioritising support for permanent resettlement in existing neighbourhoods, rather than focusing on working in camps or providing temporary shelter.},

It represents a significant mind-set shift for the evaluation field and it is a powerful tool to tackle complex environments. Heir to the systems concepts of the engineering field, and especially regarding the hard systems tools, ST in evaluation uses the same visual tools that were created many years ago. All these tools already incorporate data visualization features: they depict ideas, relationships and concepts relying in shapes and figures more than a textual explanation. Revisiting these tools and applying the latest data visualization principles, they could be optimised in order to provide with more information within the same concept. Purpose: To provide ST practitioners with more informative tools in order to facilitate: - ST experts and users can optimise the application of the tools to real life models beyond the initial set up of their visual representations. - Audiences of evaluations using ST as part of the toolkit can find the outputs more apprehensible and easy to understand . Setting: Not applicable. Intervention: Not applicable. Research Design: Not applicable. Data Collection and Analysis: Not applicable. Findings: Improving ST representations of reality and systems can help both enhance ST applications and make it more accessible and comprehensible for evaluation practitioners' and users. Six ways for improving the understanding of the current stock and flow diagrams were identified. The tools proposed consist of: customizing the colours and shape of the variables and their relationships to make them more informative; highlighting the existing subsystems within the model; and providing the specific sequence for reading the main causal chains.},

Nudge theory, and more particularly, nudging may be considered an additional strategy providing some novel instruments to the already rich governance toolbox. But what is its value? The current debates on Nudge theory are often highly normative or ideologically driven and pay limited attention to more practical aspects of the theory. Is nudging evaluable as a theory and a practice, and if so how? Is there solid evidence available of nudge success over other governance interventions? What is to be considered a nudge success? What data and evaluative techniques may assist in evaluating nudging beyond individual cases? The current article seeks to explore these questions.},

  abstract = {This article proposes an approach to monitoring and evaluating advocacy that integrates theory of change and storytelling. This approach, called Narrative Assessment, addresses the feasibility of objectivity and evidence in the complex context of advocacy and proposes an evaluation methodology rooted in alternative conceptualizations of rigour and of evaluator roles. The approach centres on practical judgment and the construction and examination of stories through interaction between advocates and monitoring and evaluation specialists. The article discusses how Narrative Assessment can be useful in the evaluation of advocacy in terms of (1) monitoring and evaluation specialists' orientation toward programmes; (2) the interpretation of outcomes; (3) the assessment of outcome relevance; (4) reflection and learning and (5) the communication of programme results. The approach builds on lessons drawn from evaluation of eight advocacy programmes in international development.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The recruitment of community health volunteers to support the delivery of health programmes is a well-established approach in many countries, particularly where health services are not readily available. However, studies on management of volunteers are scarce and current research on human resource management of volunteers faces methodological challenges. This paper presents the protocol of a realist evaluation that aims at identifying the factors influencing the performance of community health volunteers involved in the delivery of a Red Cross immunisation programme in Kampala (Uganda) with a specific focus on motivation.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: The realist evaluation cycle structures the protocol. To develop the theoretical basis for the evaluation, the authors conducted interviews and reviewed the literature on community health volunteers' performance, management and organisational behaviour. This led to the formulation of the initial programme theory, which links the intervention inputs (capacity-building strategies) to the expected outcomes (positive work behaviour) with mechanisms that point in the direction of drivers of motivation. The contextual elements include components such as organisational culture, resource availability, etc. A case study design will be adopted. We define a case as a Red Cross branch, run by a programme manager, and will select two cases at the district level in Kampala. Mixed methods will be used in data collection, including individual interviews of volunteers, participant observation and document review. The thematic analysis will be based on the initial programme theory and will seek for context-mechanism-outcome configurations. Findings from the two cases will be compared.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nDISCUSSION: We discuss the scope for applying realist evaluation and the methodological challenges we encountered in developing this protocol.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the Ethical Committee at Rennes University Hospital, France. Results will be published in scientific journals, and communicated to respondents and relevant institutions.},

Talk of failure is commonplace in development, and this paper seeks to use that as a heuristic to understand what that it signifies beyond face value. Drawing on a wide range of primary and secondary texts to provide illustrative evidence, the paper explores how failure is constructed, and advances a three-fold typology of failures that vary in terms of their positionality, the critical variables they identify as responsible, their epistemological stance, and the importance they accord to politics.},

"Introduction In the looking glass world of development,1 pessimism reigns, and things always fall apart. Dysfunctionality, collapse, disaster, poverty, famine, violence, and exploitation are not words used to signify the extraordinary, but are the normal vocabulary of everyday business. Many of the widely available texts on the subject present themselves as analytics of failure. The title of Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson's book is Why Nations Fail. James Scott's seminal book Seeing Like A State has the sub-title How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition have Failed". Paul Collier's Bottom Billion is similarly about Why the Poorest Countries are Failing. Dambisa Moyo's book on Dead Aid is about Why Aid is not Working. Bill Easterly's book on the White Man's Burden is about Why the West's Efforts to Aid the Rest have done so much Ill" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D7Z2Y95B?page=1}{Venugopal 2018:10})

\par
"Easterly (2009) for example, argues that the design of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and their unachievable targets rendered what were actually impressive successes in Africa to be categorised as demoralising failures. Similarly, Kumar and Corbridge (2002) argue that DFID's Eastern India Rainfed Farming Project (EIRFP) actually succeeded in many economic measures, but was declared a failure because it did not meet criteria that, even its planners would probably agree, were impossible to meet" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D7Z2Y95B?page=2}{Venugopal 2018:11})}

  pages = {88},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND:In recent years, Voluntary Assisted Return Programmes (VARPs) have received increasing funding as a potential way of reducing the number of refugees in EU member states. A number of factors may affect the mental well-being of returnees. These include adjustment to the home country following return, difficult living conditions, and long-term effects resulting from the severe traumatic stress that had originally driven the affected out of their homes. Little is known about the extent to which these and other factors may promote or inhibit the willingness of refugees to return to their country of origin. The present pilot study investigated refugees who returned to their country of origin after having lived in exile in Germany for some 13 years.METHODS:Forty-seven VARP participants were interviewed concerning their present living conditions, their views of their native country, and their attitudes towards a potential return prior to actually returning. 33 participants were interviewed nine months after returning to their country of origin. Mental health and well-being were assessed using the questionnaires Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS) and EUROHIS and the structured Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.).Our objectives were to examine the mental health status of refugees returning to their home country following an extended period of exile. We also aimed to assess the circumstances under which people decided to return, the current living conditions in their home country, and retrospective returnee evaluations of their decision to accept assisted return.RESULTS:Prior to returning to their home country, participants showed a prevalence rate of 53\% for psychiatric disorders. After returning, this rate increased to a sizeable 88\%. Substantial correlations were found between the living situation in Germany, the disposition to return, and mental health. For two thirds of the participants, the decision to return was not voluntary.CONCLUSION:Psychological strain among study participants was of a considerable magnitude. As a result of traumatic stress experienced during war and refuge, victims were vulnerable and not well equipped to cope with either post-migration stressors in exile or with a return to their country of origin. It is noteworthy that the majority returned under pressure from immigration authorities. Living conditions after return (such as housing, work, and health care) were poor and unstable. Participants also had great difficulty readapting to the cultural environment after having lived abroad for an average of 13 years. Current VARPs do not take these factors into account and are therefore not able to assist in a humanitarian reintegration of voluntary returnees.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Many refugees live for years in exile. The combination of stress in the host country, together with long-term effects resulting from traumatic stress usually experienced in the home country may affect mental health. Little is known, to what extent these and other factors promote or stall the willingness to return to the country of origin. Here, we investigate, as an example, refugees who will return to their country of origin after having lived in exile in Germany for some 11 years.OBJECTIVE:What is the mental health status of returnees before the actual return who have been living in exile for an extended period? We also asked, what are the current living conditions in Germany and what are the motives for and reasons against a voluntary return to the country of origin?METHODS:Forty-seven participants of programs for assisted voluntarreturn were interviewed about their present living situation, their view regarding their home country and voluntary return. These findings were compared to a group of 53 refugees who had decided to remain in Germany (stayers). Participants were recruited by means of advertisements posted in refugee centres, language schools, at doctors' offices and in organisations involved in the management of voluntary return in Germany. The prevalence of psychiatric disorders among respondents was tested using the structured interview M.I.N.I. The Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS) was used to assess PTSD in more detail and EUROHIS was applied to measure the subjective quality of life of participants.RESULTS:We found a prevalence rate of 44\% psychiatric disorders in the group of returnees and a rate of 78\% in the group of stayers. We also recorded substantial correlations between the living situation in Germany, disposition to return and mental health. In almost two thirds of the participants the decision to return was not voluntary but strongly influenced by immigration authorities. The most important reason for participants to opt for a stay in Germany were their children, who have been born and raised in Germany.CONCLUSION:Psychological strains among the study participants were very high. Traumatic stress, experienced during war and refuge, has left the victims vulnerable and not well equipped to cope with post-migration stressors in exile. It is noteworthy that the majority returned under pressure of the immigration authorities. The fear of an uncertain future after the return was substantial. These factors should be taken into account in programs designed to assist returnees, including those that offer support after return to the country of origin.}

It covers three major issues that have not been adequately addressed by previous writings on process tracing: the relationship of single case studies to more general causal claims, the conceptualization of causation, and the criteria of valid causal inference. It introduces the ``completeness standard,'' which combines causal graphs, event history maps, and invariant causal mechanisms. The completeness standard, it argues, bridges unitlevel causal inferences and average treatment effects, invokes an epistemologically warranted conceptualization of causation, and better satisfies existing standards of causal inference by making unit homogeneity assumptions more credible.},

  abstract = {Background: Shared Decision-making (SDM), a medical decision-making model, was popularized in the late 1980s in reaction to then predominate paternalistic decision-making, aiming to better meet the needs of patients. Extensive research has been conducted internationally examining the benefits of SDM implementation; however, existing theory on how SDM works, for whom, in which circumstances, and why is limited. While literature has shown positive patient, health care provider, and system benefits (SDM outputs), further research is required to understand the nuances of this type of decision-making. As such, we set out to address: "In which situations, how, why, and for whom does SDM between patients and health care providers contribute to improved engagement in the Shared Decision-making process?" Methods: To achieve our study goals we conducted a seven-step realist synthesis process, which included: (1) preliminary program theory development, (2) search strategy development, (3) selection and appraisal of literature in accordance with realist methodology, (4) data extraction, (5) identification of relevant formal theories, (6) data analysis and synthesis, and (7) formation of a revised program theory with the input of stakeholders. This process was done in accordance with RAMESES guidelines and publication standards for a realist synthesis. Expert consultations were also held to ensure consistency within the SDM literature. Results: Through our realist synthesis, we developed a program theory of SDM which includes three contexts (pre-existing relationship, difficulty of decision, and system support), eight mechanism sets (anxiety, trust, perception of other party capacity, perception of time, self-efficacy, world view, perception of capacity to external support, and recognition of decision), and one outcome (engagement in SDM). Conclusions: As far as the authors of this paper are aware, this paper is the first to begin unpacking how SDM works, for whom, in which circumstances, and why. By examining key mechanism sets and exploring how they facilitate or inhibit SDM, we have produced a program theory that may assist health care professionals, policy makers, and patients. While further research is suggested to further unpack the concepts identified within this paper, this provides an initial understanding into the theory behind SDM.

  abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein-protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 \textbackslash AA for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Current approaches to understanding and resolving the problem of poverty have not proved effective. This paper aims to provide a new explanation of why we have failed and what must be done to improve our understanding, decision-making, action and success. Design/methodology/approach: Integrative propositional analysis is used to evaluate and synthesize theoretical and practical perspectives on poverty from five academic disciplines and five disparate organizations. Findings: Individual theoretical perspectives were found to have low levels of complexity and systemicity. Research limitations/implications: Clear research directions are shown to accelerate improvements in understanding. Additionally, results may provide a useful guide for developing computer models of poverty. Practical implications: The causal knowledge map of synthesized theories suggests where practice may be relatively effective and where unanticipated consequences are more likely to occur. Social implications: Policy decision-making to address the problem of poverty is not likely to lead to successful resolution. Thus, poverty is likely to continue until we develop a more systemic understanding. Originality/value: This interdisciplinary paper provides a new structural perspective on why we have not been able to solve the poverty problem \textendash{} and shows how far we have yet to go to reach success.},

Using a few simple rules, IPA provides a concrete visual-mapping approach to integrating theories. And, of equal or greater importance, IPA provides an effective method for measuring `how integrated' or `how coherent' theories are as a new way to predict how useful the theory will be for representing our understanding of complex situations and improving the ability of individuals, organizations, and coalitions to take effective action based on those theories. This is expected to be particularly useful for students and interdisciplinary teams for integrating theoretical perspectives in an initial assessment of problems and situations.},

  abstract = {STRATEGIC KNOWLEDGE MAPPING: THE CO-CREATION OF USEFUL KNOWLEDGE Steven E. Wallis, Bernadette Wright ABSTRACT Strategic planning typically involves conducting research and setting objectives. It is a difficult and expensive process with no guarantee of success. Recent research shows that managers with more ``structured'' knowledge will be more successful. Using Integrative Propositional Analysis (IPA) we can objectively determine the potential usefulness of a Strategic Knowledge Map (SKM). Creating an effective SKM is a precursor to more easily creating a more effective strategic plan. The present game is focused on players co-creating an SKM. Their play is scored in such a way that they will receive more points for creating a more structured map. The resulting map may be easily used in the ``real world'' to support dialog, decision making, and the creation of specific objectives for strategic plans. The game is unorthodox. It is not a simulation where play begins with a pre-set ``world.'' Similarly, the game is not educational in the traditional sense where players attempt to acquire or test knowledge using an existing database. Instead, ASK MATT is a model-building game where knowledge is co-created within the game by the players. Further, the game goes beyond finding ``insights;'' instead, the results of the game may be directly applied as a guide to real world situations. In the present paper, we explore the background, difficulties, and opportunities for improving strategic planning and policy planning using strategic knowledge mapping from a systemic perspective. We explain the play of the game, its scoring, anticipated outcomes, our experiences playtesting the game with small groups, plans for playtesting with larger groups, and opportunities for developing a version of the game that may be played online and/or as an APP.},

This paper investigates levels to better understand how theories are structured and so how we may develop more useful theories and models to better support more effective practice. We find a horizontal dimension (represented by causal connections between concepts at one ontological level) and a vertical dimension (represented by connections of emergence between concepts of differing ontological levels). This view of emergence offers a new way to structurally distinguish between conceptual components of a theory, thus supporting a new approach to building theories that better reflects our systemic world. A third, perspectival, approach may be applied to aid in the understanding of both dimensions. A typology is proposed as are conventions for diagramming theories and new criteria for improving the structure of theories.},

There was no relation between reports of growth on the PTGI and socially desirable responding or negative mood. Higher PTGI scores were associated with greater positive mood and greater depth of processing in the essays. These findings support the validity of stress-related growth as a construct and its assessment via questionnaire. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2008 APA, all rights reserved)}

This study was designed to adapt and validate a Spanish translation of the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) for the assessment of positive life changes following the stressful experiences of immigration. Method. A cross-cultural equivalence model was used to pursue semantic, content, conceptual, and technical equivalence. Translation teams and back translations were employed for semantic and content equivalence. Conceptual and technical equivalence were assessed through field-testing the reliability and factor structure of the translated PTGI in a sample of 100 Latina immigrants. Results. The translated version was highly reliable. Factor analysis failed to replicate the original five factors but the three factors identified were consistent with the conceptual underpinnings of the PTGI and another translated version. Conclusions. Semantic, content, conceptual, and technical equivalence of the Spanish version of the PTGI were supported and thus its valid use for research and practice with the study population.}

Sometimes seen as incompatible, it is argued here that complexity theory and realist evaluation are `natural bedfellows'. Because of their similarities and differences, evaluators can usefully draw on both perspectives within the same evaluation. One way to do so is to draw on key concepts from each in the selection and use of substantive theory. The article introduces the concept of `complexity-consistent' substantive theories and suggests that this is useful for the evaluation of policies and programs in complex adaptive systems. It demonstrates how substantive theories can be analysed in complexity terms, how multiple theories can be `layered' to reflect multiple levels of systems, and how such theories can be used within evaluation design and analysis.},

It is widely accepted that a theory - based approach to impact evaluation, one that maps out the causal chain from inputs to outcomes and impact and tests the underlying assumptions, will shed light on the why question. But application of a theory-based approach remains weak. This paper identifies the following six principles to successful application of the approach: (1) map out the causal chain (programme theory); (2) understand context; (3) anticipate heterogeneity; (4) rigorous evaluation of impact using a credible counterfactual; (5) rigorous factual analysis; and (6) use mixed methods.},

It also explores the apparently prevalent belief that psychosocial interventions can be delivered as 'relief packages' to those affected, and as part of project-based, rather than process-enabling, interventions. The need for an integrated approach to psychosocial intervention following disasters remains a challenge for humanitarian agencies and local authorities in post-disaster settings. Regulatory mechanisms for non-governmental organisation's (NGO's), charitable or individual groups, seeking to 'intervene' in the mental health and psychosocial sphere in the aftermath of disasters, are challenging the complex political, donor, humanitarian and resource-poor gradients. This discussion serves to highlight the significant task of balancing humanitarian compassion with effective psychosocial programming, especially in resource-poor contexts that seem to readily absorb such interventions.

  abstract = {We discuss the expectancy\textendash value theory of motivation, focusing on an expec-tancy\textendash value model developed and researched by Eccles, Wigfield, and their col-leagues. Definitions of crucial constructs in the model, including ability beliefs, expectancies for success, and the components of subjective task values, are pro-vided. These definitions are compared to those of related constructs, including self-efficacy, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, and interest. Research is reviewed dealing with two issues: (1) change in children's and adolescents' ability beliefs, expectancies for success, and subjective values, and (2) relations of children's and adolescents' ability-expectancy beliefs and subjective task values to their perfor-mance and choice of activities. Achievement motivation theorists attempt to explain people's choice of achievement tasks, persistence on those tasks, vigor in carrying them out, and performance on them (Eccles, Wigfield, \& Schiefele, 1998; Pintrich \& Schunk, 1996). As discussed by Murphy and Alexander (this issue), there are a variety of constructs posited by motivation theorists to explain how motivation influences choice, persistence, and performance. One long-stand-ing perspective on motivation is expectancy\textendash value theory. Theorists in this tradition argue that individuals' choice, persistence, and performance can be explained by their beliefs about how well they will do on the activity and the extent to which they value the activity (Atkinson, 1957; Eccles et al., 1983; Wigfield, 1994; Wigfield \& Eccles, 1992).

Due to their popularity and flexibility, Theories of Change can vary greatly, from the nuanced and nested, through to simplified and linear. We present a methodology for building genuinely holistic, complexity-appropriate, system-based Theory of Change diagrams, using Participatory Systems Mapping as a starting point. Participatory System Maps provide a general-purpose resource that can be used in many ways; however, knowing how to turn their complex view of a system into something actionable for evaluation purposes is difficult. The methodology outlined in this article gives this starting point and plots a path through from systems mapping to a Theory of Change evaluators can use. It allows evaluators to develop practical Theories of Change that take into account feedbacks, wider context and potential negative or unexpected outcomes. We use the example of the energy trilemma map presented elsewhere in this special issue to demonstrate.},

(Wisner et al 2004:20)"One approach was unapologetically naturalist" (Wisner et al 2004:20)"Other views of 'man [sic] and nature' (e.g. Burton et al. 1978; Whittow 1980) involved a more subtle environmental determinism," (Wisner et al 2004:20)"It was assumed that 'progress' and 'modernisation' were taking place, and that 'folk' and 'mixed' societies would become 'industrial'," (Wisner et al 2004:21)"The 1970s saw increasing attempts to use 'political economy' to counter modernisation theory and its triumphalist outlook" (Wisner et al 2004:21)"We avoid notions of vulnerability that do no more than identify it with 'poverty'" (Wisner et al 2004:21)"We also reject those definitions of vulnerability that focus exclusively on the ability of a system to cope with risk or loss.12" (Wisner et al 2004:21)"By vulnerability we mean the characteristics of a person or group and their situation that influence their capacity to anticipate, cope with, resist and recover from the impact of a natural hazard (an extreme natural event or process)" (Wisner et al 2004:21)"When used in this sense, the implied opposite of being vulnerable is sometimes indicated by our use of the term 'secure'.13 Other authors complement the discussions of vulnerability with the notion of 'capacity'" (Wisner et al 2004:22)"vulnerability has a time dimension built into it: vulnerability can be measured in terms of the damage to future livelihoods, and not just as what happens to life and property at the time of the hazard event." (Wisner et al 2004:22)"livelihood' is important in the definition. We mean by this the command an individual, family or other social group has over an income and/or bundles of resources that can be used or exchanged to satisfy its needs."

(Wisner et al 2004:22)"There are three important differences, however , between the vulnerability of the rich and the poor in such cases" (Wisner et al 2004:22)"Firstly, few rich people are affected if we compare the number of victims of landslides in various cities around the world." (Wisner et al 2004:22)"Secondly, living in the hazardous canyon environment is a choice made by some of the rich in California, but not by the poor Brazilian or Philippine job seekers" (Wisner et al 2004:23)"Thirdly, the consequences of a landslide for the rich are far less severe than for the surviving poor." (Wisner et al 2004:23)"in danger of showing people as passive and incapable of bringing about change." (Wisner et al 2004:24)"now more interest in trying to quantify vulnerability as a tool of planning and policy making" (Wisner et al 2004:24)"Thus, the conversion of risk is turned into a common metric, which enables different hazards to be compared (Rosa 1998), and this is the main analytical route taken by this book. Disaster impact is measured by a range of etic (external) and objectively verifiable indicators, such as mortality, morbidity, damage to property and physical assets, reduction in savings and so on." (Wisner et al 2004:24)"these indicators are not sufficient, and we are aware that they tend to under-emphasise the cultural, the psychosomatic and subjective aspects of disaster impact" (Wisner et al 2004:24)"drawing down of different 'capitals' and the conversion of one to another" (Wisner et al 2004:25)"offers a more holistic view of well-being and decision making, particularly under conditions of 'normal' life, and this is a contemporary development of disaster theory which we elaborate on at length in Chapter 3." (Wisner et al 2004:25)"However , even this approach tends to make many untested and simplistic assumptions about preferences, choices and values, particularly under conditions of acute stress and extraordinary circumstances." (Wisner et al 2004:25)"Fourthly, overlapping with the previous point, there is a movement away from simple taxonomies or checklists of 'vulnerable groups' to a concern with 'vulnerable situations', which people move into and out of over time." (Wisner et al 2004:25)"'Vulnerability', as we use the word, refers only to people, not to buildings (susceptible, unsafe), economies (fragile), nor unstable slopes (hazardous) or regions of the earth's surface (hazard-prone)." (Wisner et al 2004:25)"Special interest non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have produced detailed checklists to take account of the particular needs and vulnerabilities of such groups as elderly people or unaccompanied children, both in vulnerability/capacity assessments as well as post-disaster needs assessments (see Chapter 9). These post-disaster tools are very useful as aides m\'emoires for busy administrators and case workers" (Wisner et al 2004:25)"But the use of post-disaster checklists does not in itself help one to understand why and how those characteristics have come to be associated with a higher probability of injury, death, livelihood disruption and greater difficulty in recovery" (Wisner et al 2004:25)However, the empirical discoveryof an association or correlation does not explain the process that gave rise to the association xi realist{$\Exclam$}!

(Wisner et al 2004:26)"There is a large and growing literature on risk that we acknowledge but do not directly engage with in this book. The main reason is that it focuses primarily on technological hazards" (Wisner et al 2004:26)"One influential author writing about risk during the 1980s and 1990s is Ulrich Beck. His books Risk Society: Toward a New Modernity? (1992) and Ecological Politics in the Age of Risk (1995)," (Wisner et al 2004:26)"Beck maintains that the more developed world is in a transitional state between industrial society and 'risk society': with so much wealth also come risks." (Wisner et al 2004:27)"Thus, industrial, affluent society is increasingly protected against the uncertainties faced in LDCs through the application of technology and higher levels of income. Yet it is none the less increasingly preoccupied with incalculable and diffuse risks," (Wisner et al 2004:27)"use of Beck's notion of reflexive modernisation that we find much closer to our purposes of the analysis of disasters in LDCs. While it can lead to perpetual anxiety and the self-defeating approach of ecological modernisation discussed above, reflexive modernisation can result in more focused political demands on authorities to address what we could call the 'root causes' of vulnerability." (Wisner et al 2004:28)"Moving across the continuum, there are what could be termed 'weak constructionist' approaches, where risk is an objective hazard but is always mediated through social and cultural processes (Oliver-Smith and Hoffman 1999)." (Wisner et al 2004:29)"This book broadly takes a realist, and at times a weak constructionist, approach to risk." (Wisner et al 2004:29)"better theoretical understanding of disasters are possible only if one places the phenomenon of disaster 'in the mainstream' of policy and practice. Hewitt made this point twenty years ago when he wrote of how disasters had been mentally exiled to an 'archipelago' of exceptionalism (Hewitt 1983b)" (Wisner et al 2004:30)"In 1998, hurricane Mitch struck several Central American countries and made it obvious that it was underlying processes of land degradation and de-vegetation that made people vulnerable (see Chapter 7)." (Wisner et al 2004:32)"The death toll from this hurricane is estimated to have been 27,000 people, most of these in Honduras and Nicaragua. The majority of these deaths were from floods and landslides that could have been prevented if so much of these countries had not been stripped of their forest cover." (Wisner et al 2004:32)"In 2002, the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development reaffirmed the place of disaster risk reduction within its notion of 'sustainable development'." (Wisner et al 2004:32)"'vulnerability gap', 'which is widening within society," (Wisner et al 2004:32)"The HDI again turns out to be the best predictor of deaths triggered by extreme natural events." (Wisner et al 2004:36)"Although in 1998 the UNDP was able to conclude that, on average, health had improved in the previous 30 years (UNDP 1998: 21\textendash 23), in many African countries this was certainly not the" (Wisner et al 2004:36)"Typically the most underreported humanitarian crises listed by M\'edecins Sans Fronti\`eres (MSF) for 2001 tend to be slow onset, long-term disasters, most often linked to war or post-war situations." (Wisner et al 2004:38)"The Pressure and Release (PAR) model and the Household Access model, originally presented in the first edition of At Risk and re-introduced in an improved format in this edition," (Wisner et al 2004:41)"Poverty is not synonymous with vulnerability." (Wisner et al 2004:42)"While all of these are components of people's vulnerability, a building should be regarded as unsafe, rather than vulnerable; a settlement's location is hazardous, not vulnerable." (Wisner et al 2004:65)"Limits to our knowledge Vulnerability can be assessed reasonably precisely for a specific group of people living and working at a specific time and place, and the 'unsafe conditions' that contribute to it have been the subject of a great deal of research reviewed in this book. In much of the world, detailed knowledge has been obtained about which sites might be affected in a landslide, which buildings will survive or collapse in an earthquake and why, or about the outcomes of drought in terms of food production and possible shortfalls." (Wisner et al 2004:70)"However , as we move up the chain of explanation from unsafe conditions to root causes, the linkages (and therefore the level of precision in disaster explanation) become less definite." (Wisner et al 2004:71)"How good are disaster statistics?" (Wisner et al 2004:75)"In some countries, or regions of a country, even in 'normal' times there may be poor coverage of vital statistics, with many births and deaths going unrecorded." (Wisner et al 2004:76)"Others are never found, and are 'missing', but are never recorded as 'dead'," (Wisner et al 2004:76)"Thirdly, there can be political pressures either to overstate or to understate casualties." (Wisner et al 2004:76)"'[W]ith economic effects it' s difficult to assess which changes are caused by the disaster and which would have happened anyway . That is, there's always the problem that it' s easier to compare before and after the disaster , but what we really should be comparing is with and without the disaster'." (Wisner et al 2004:76)"difficult to object to the idea that population growth is a significant global pressure contributing to increasing vulnerability, and yet the linkages remain uncharted except in rather simplistic terms (e.g. there are more people, therefore some have to live in dangerous places). There are difficulties in trying to explain demographic change more carefully . For instance, there is considerable debate about whether population growth is a cause or a consequence of poverty in LDCs" (Wisner et al 2004:77)"The apparently illogical behaviour of people who seem to have too many children in hazardous places can be seen to be more logical (if no less risky) in the context of the Access model used in Chapter 3." (Wisner et al 2004:77)"As a dynamic pressure, population growth does not seem to us as important as change and age structure (see Box 2.4). In southern Africa as a result of the HIV-AIDS epidemic life expectancy and growth rates are falling, not increasing. This instability in population change is causing severe dislocation in the rural economy and complicating recovery from the drought of 2001\textendash 2002." (Wisner et al 2004:78)"At the other end of the age spectrum there is also a growing challenge posed by the ageing populations of Japan, North America and Europe." (Wisner et al 2004:78)"specific risk-reduction policies will be needed to focus on the protection of the elderly" (Wisner et al 2004:78)stopped reading this very intersting section on distal risks around here (note on p.82)"the PAR model does not provide a detailed and theoretically informed analysis of the precise interactions of environment and society at the 'pressure point', at the point where and when the disaster starts to unfold" (Wisner et al 2004:97)"Households earn their livelihoods in normal times (Box 1), and are subject to unsafe conditions (Box 2) and the political economy in which they all live is also shaped by social relations and structures of domination (Boxes 1a and 1b)." (Wisner et al 2004:100)"." (Wisner et al 2004:100)"It must be noted here that some disasters occur without a clear-cut, single, natural hazard trigger , nor perhaps with an identifiable event in the political economy . Instead, there are multiple contributing events which together constitute a 'complex emergency', which then unfolds in all its intractable complexity over a long period of time. An example is the situation in 2001\textendash 2003 in Zimbabwe, which has gone from a country producing a surplus of food into one facing bankruptcy and impending famine, in a complex mix of drought and political conflict." (Wisner et al 2004:101)"The PAR model, which forms a 'chain of explanation', is an analytical tool, subject to a number of inadequacies which we have tried to illustrate. One of its weaknesses is that the generation of vulnerability is not" (Wisner et al 2004:101)"adequately integrated with the way in which hazards themselves affect people; it is a static model. It exaggerates the separation of the hazard from social processes in order to emphasise the social causation of disasters." (Wisner et al 2004:102)"In this Access model, the political economy is modelled in two related systems. The first is called social relations (Figure 3.1, Box 1a) and encompasses the flows of goods, money and surplus between different actors (for example, merchants, urban rentiers, capitalist producers of food, rural and urban households involved in various relations of production and endowed with a particular range and quality of access to resources, called an access profile [see below])" (Wisner et al 2004:104)"The second system is termed structures of domination (Figure 3.1, Box 1b), and refers to the politics of relations between people at different levels. These include relations within the household, between men and women, children and adults, seniors and juniors." (Wisner et al 2004:104)"The structures of domination also include the wider family and kinship ties of reciprocity and obligation at a more extended (and usually less intensive) level, and those between classes that are defined economically (such as employer and worker, patron and client) and between members of different ethnic groups." (Wisner et al 2004:104)"Livelihood analysis seeks to explain how a person obtains a livelihood by drawing upon and combining five types of 'capital', which are similar to the assets that are involved in our Access model: 1 human capital (skills, knowledge, health and energy); 2 social capital (networks, groups, institutions); 3 physical capital (infrastructure, technology and equipment); 4 financial capital (savings, credit); 5 natural capital (natural resources, land, water, fauna and flora)." (Wisner et al 2004:106)"The Access model remains in this edition an economistic model, which can be as precise, deterministic and quantitative as the user wishes." (Wisner et al 2004:106)"The root causes, dynamic pressures and unsafe conditions which the PAR framework deals with are treated as qualitative inputs into the Access model and have to be specified in more detail through the dynamic operation of structures of domination and social relations." (Wisner et al 2004:106)"Each household makes choices, within constraints, to take up one or more livelihoods or income opportunities" (Wisner et al 2004:109)"income opportunity has a set of access qualifications (Box 3b" (Wisner et al 2004:110)"Access to all the resources that each individual or household possesses can collectively be called its access profile" (Wisner et al 2004:110)"What is of more immediate and specific importance are the structures of domination and social relations at the local level (Boxes 1 and 4 in Figure 3.2), or the 'rules of the political economic game' for the microcosm of households selected in this model. Between individuals within a household, these involve the allocation of food, who eats first, who will have to absorb consumption cut-backs in times of dearth or who receives medical treatment. Gender politics within the household are of great importance here," (Wisner et al 2004:112)"women and children sometimes bear the brunt of disasters because of the power of male members of the household to allocate food while in refugee camps" (Wisner et al 2004:112)lots of rich stuff (note on p.115)}

"Limits to our knowledge Vulnerability can be assessed reasonably precisely for a specific group of people living and working at a specific time and place, and the 'unsafe conditions' that contribute to it have been the subject of a great deal of research reviewed in this book.

"difficult to object to the idea that population growth is a significant global pressure contributing to increasing vulnerability, and yet the linkages remain uncharted except in rather simplistic terms (e.g. there are more people, therefore some have to live in dangerous places).

"It must be noted here that some disasters occur without a clear-cut, single, natural hazard trigger , nor perhaps with an identifiable event in the political economy . Instead, there are multiple contributing events which together constitute a 'complex emergency', which then unfolds in all its intractable complexity over a long period of time. An example is the situation in 2001\textendash 2003 in Zimbabwe, which has gone from a country producing a surplus of food into one facing bankruptcy and impending famine, in a complex mix of drought and political conflict."

\par
"In this Access model, the political economy is modelled in two related systems. The first is called social relations (Figure 3.1, Box 1a) and encompasses the flows of goods, money and surplus between different actors (for example, merchants, urban rentiers, capitalist producers of food, rural and urban households involved in various relations of production and endowed with a particular range and quality of access to resources, called an access profile [see below])" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_N45QEGQV/104}{Wisner et al 2004:104})

"Livelihood analysis seeks to explain how a person obtains a livelihood by drawing upon and combining five types of 'capital', which are similar to the assets that are involved in our Access model: 1 human capital (skills, knowledge, health and energy); 2 social capital (networks, groups, institutions); 3 physical capital (infrastructure, technology and equipment); 4 financial capital (savings, credit); 5 natural capital (natural resources, land, water, fauna and flora)."

Between individuals within a household, these involve the allocation of food, who eats first, who will have to absorb consumption cut-backs in times of dearth or who receives medical treatment. Gender politics within the household are of great importance here," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_N45QEGQV/112}{Wisner et al 2004:112})

  abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein-protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 \textbackslash AA for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

This makes it difficult to find the best theory for application in teaching, practice, and research. Choosing the right entrepreneurship theories to teach and encourage is critical to providing entrepreneurs with the knowledge they need to succeed. Scholars have recommended integrating entrepreneurship theories across disciplines and across practice; however, rigorous methods to assess and integrate the best theories are lacking. Integrative propositional analysis is an emerging method to assess and improve theories using the theory structure as data, rather than relying on empirical data and opinion alone. This exploratory study pilot tested this approach with a sample of nine entrepreneurship theories. Several insights emerged that entrepreneurship researchers, educators, and practitioners can use to synthesize and improve theories for their specific needs and to collaboratively integrate the best theories from research and experience to create better theories.},

  abstract = {Background: Chronic diseases are a serious and urgent problem, requiring at-scale, multi-component, multi-stakeholder action and cooperation. Despite numerous national frameworks and agenda-setting documents to coordinate prevention efforts, Australia, like many countries internationally, is yet to substantively impact the burden from chronic disease. Improved evidence on effective strategies for the prevention of chronic disease is required. This research sought to articulate a priority set of important and feasible action domains to inform future discussion and debate regarding priority areas for chronic disease prevention policy and strategy. Methods: Using concept mapping, a mixed-methods approach to making use of the best available tacit knowledge of recognised, diverse and well-experienced actors, and national actions to improve the prevention of chronic disease in Australia were identified and then mapped. Participants (ranging from 58 to 78 in the various stages of the research) included a national sample of academics, policymakers and practitioners. Data collection involved the generation and sorting of statements by participants. A series of visual representations of the data were then developed. Results: A total of 95 statements were distilled into 12 clusters for action, namely Inter-Sectoral Partnerships; Systems Perspective/Action; Governance; Roles and Responsibilities; Evidence, Feedback and Learning; Funding and Incentive; Creating Demand; Primary Prevention; Social Determinants and Equity; Healthy Environments; Food and Nutrition; and Regulation and Policy. Specific areas for more immediate national action included refocusing the health system to prevention over cure, raising the profile of public health with health decision-makers, funding policy- and practice-relevant research, improving communication about prevention, learning from both global best-practice and domestic successes and failures, increasing the focus on primary prevention, and developing a long-term prevention strategy with an explicit funding commitment. Conclusions: Preventing chronic diseases and their risk factors will require at-scale, multi-component, multi-stakeholder action and cooperation. The concept mapping procedures used in this research have enabled the synthesis of views across different stakeholders, bringing both divergent and convergent perspectives to light, and collectively creating signals for where to prioritise national action. Previous national strategies for chronic disease prevention have not collated the tacit knowledge of diverse actors in the prevention of chronic disease in this structured way.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Ebola outbreak that is sweeping across West Africa is the largest, most volatile, and deadliest Ebola epidemic ever recorded. Liberia is the most profoundly affected country, with more than 3500 infections and 2000 deaths recorded in the past 3 months. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the contribution of disease progression and case fatality on transmission and to examine the potential for targeted interventions to eliminate the disease. DESIGN: Stochastic transmission model that integrates epidemiologic and clinical data on incidence and case fatality, daily viral load among survivors and nonsurvivors evaluated on the basis of the 2000-2001 outbreak in Uganda, and primary data on contacts of patients with Ebola in Liberia. SETTING: Montserrado County, Liberia, July to September 2014. MEASUREMENTS: Ebola incidence and case-fatality records from 2014 Liberian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. RESULTS: The average number of secondary infections generated throughout the entire infectious period of a single infected case, R, was estimated as 1.73 (95\% CI, 1.66 to 1.83). There was substantial stratification between survivors (RSurvivors), for whom the estimate was 0.66 (CI, 0.10 to 1.69), and nonsurvivors (RNonsurvivors), for whom the estimate was 2.36 (CI, 1.72 to 2.80). The nonsurvivors had the highest risk for transmitting the virus later in the course of disease progression. Consequently, the isolation of 75\% of infected individuals in critical condition within 4 days from symptom onset has a high chance of eliminating the disease. LIMITATION: Projections are based on the initial dynamics of the epidemic, which may change as the outbreak and interventions evolve. CONCLUSION: These results underscore the importance of isolating the most severely ill patients with Ebola within the first few days of their symptomatic phase.

The theoretical background to the approach is multimethodology, in line with Minger's description of paradigm crossing and is appropriately situated within the Appreciate and Analyse phases of PSM intervention. The practical use of this method has been explored and three case studies are presented from the domains of organisational change and entrepreneurial studies. The value of this method is twofold; (i) it has the potential to improve dynamic sensibility in the process of qualitative data analysis, and (ii) it can provide a more rigorous approach to developing CLDs in the formation stage of system dynamics modelling. We propose that the further development of this method requires its implementation within CAQDAS packages so that CLD creation, as a precursor to full system dynamics modelling, is contemporaneous with coding and consistent with a bridging strategy of paradigm crossing. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Using data drawn from Guatemala 1 where I lived and worked among Quiche Mayan war widows, illustrates how cultural ly-specif ic understandings of events and reactions to them affect the well-being (or otherwise) of people exposed to extreme adverse events. The paper turns2 to the voices of the widows, who experienced and survived intense political conflict, explaining their experiences of violence within their particular context.}

  abstract = {The main goal of this research was to examine the effect on early adolescents of the temporary or definite loss of their fathers on their posttraumatic adaptation (psychological state, behavioral problems, and school achievements). Researchers examined the effect of the exposure of 816 adolescents (10-15 yr olds in Sarajevo who were 6-12 yrs old at the time of the war) to the 1992-95 war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to postwar-related stressful/traumatic experiences. In particular, they examined the level of depression in these Ss who experienced temporary or definite traumatic loss of a father, many of whom had no valid information about their fathers' fates. The Ss completed questionnaires on their war-related trauma experiences and completed the Birleson Depression Scale for Children. Results show that the group of early adolescents whose fathers had disappeared (and are still missing) was the group exposed most to war-related traumatic events; these adolescents also show the highest level of depressive reactions.

  abstract = {In recent years, quantitative research methodology has become more conceptually integrated and technically sophisticated. Fundamental insights regarding design and analytic frameworks that support causal inference along with the development of estimation algorithms appropriate for multilevel and latent variable models have altered traditional methodological practice and ushered in new appreciation for the underlying relationship among modern data modeling techniques. In this article, I provide a brief outline of five methodological content domains that have increasing relevance for quantitatively oriented evaluators, (1) causal inference/experimental design, (2) multilevel modeling, (3) structural equation/latent variable modeling, (4) longitudinal data analysis, and (5) missing data, and the accompanying textbook resources that facilitate understanding and use. A target audience for each text is also identified.},
