In November 2019, the Global Health Security (GHS) Index was released as the first detailed assessment and benchmarking of 195 countries to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats. This paper presents the first comparison of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD countries' performance during the pandemic, with the pre-COVID-19 pandemic preparedness as determined by the GHS Index. Using a rank-based analysis, four indices were compared between select countries, including total cases, total deaths, recovery rate, and total tests performed, all standardized for comparison. Our findings suggest a discrepancy between the GHS index rating and the actual performance of countries during this pandemic, with an overestimation of the preparedness of some countries scoring highly on the GHS index and underestimation of the preparedness of other countries with relatively lower scores on the GHS index.},

Responding to this call, this paper offers an exposition of a causal mapping technique. In the project management literature, there already exists a small number of articles reporting effective use of causal mapping. However, these are not dedicated to detailed explanation of the technique itself and so lack consideration of its features beyond those relevant to a particular application. Consequently, an exposition of the technique is needed to enable comprehensive understanding of causal mapping to be gained and its suitability for research designs assessed. Specifically, this paper examines causal mapping's theoretical grounding, explores its strengths and weakness, presents example applications, compares alternative causal mapping approaches, and overall, explains how causal mapping can support a systemic perspective on projects. These issues will be of interest to researchers who wish to incorporate causal mapping into their project management research designs.},

Managers are faced with the need to effectively work with a multitude of parties and deal with a wealth of interlocking uncertainties. This paper describes a modelling process developed to assist managers facing such situations. The process helps managers to develop a comprehensive appreciation of risks and gain an understanding of the impact of the interactions between these risks through explicitly engaging a wide stakeholder base using a group support system and causal mapping process. Using a real case the paper describes the modelling process and outcomes along with its implications, before reflecting on the insights, limitations and future research. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Despite recent successes of reinforcement learning (RL), it remains a challenge for agents to transfer learned skills to related environments. To facilitate research addressing this problem, we propose CausalWorld, a benchmark for causal structure and transfer learning in a robotic manipulation environment. The environment is a simulation of an open-source robotic platform, hence offering the possibility of sim-to-real transfer. Tasks consist of constructing 3D shapes from a given set of blocks - inspired by how children learn to build complex structures. The key strength of CausalWorld is that it provides a combinatorial family of such tasks with common causal structure and underlying factors (including, e.g., robot and object masses, colors, sizes). The user (or the agent) may intervene on all causal variables, which allows for fine-grained control over how similar different tasks (or task distributions) are. One can thus easily define training and evaluation distributions of a desired difficulty level, targeting a specific form of generalization (e.g., only changes in appearance or object mass). Further, this common parametrization facilitates defining curricula by interpolating between an initial and a target task. While users may define their own task distributions, we present eight meaningful distributions as concrete benchmarks, ranging from simple to very challenging, all of which require long-horizon planning as well as precise low-level motor control. Finally, we provide baseline results for a subset of these tasks on distinct training curricula and corresponding evaluation protocols, verifying the feasibility of the tasks in this benchmark.},

  abstract = {Research dealing with various aspects of the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, 1987) is reviewed, and some unresolved issues are discussed. In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability. \textcopyright{} 1991.},

It is found that social capital, a complex and compound construct, can be both an asset and a liability with respect to mental health of those in receipt of and those providing services and other interventions. The most meaningful assessment of social capital or components thereof may examine individual access to rather than possession of social capital, a property of groups, and therefore an ecological variable. Theoretical advances in research on social capital serve to identify mainly two types of social capital: bonding (between individuals in a group) and bridging (between groups). Each type of social capital has cognitive and/or structural component(s) and may operate at micro and/or macro level(s). Effective mental health policy and service provision may build or strengthen bridging social capital and benefit from both bonding and bridging social capital where either or both exist. Established indicators of social capital are amenable to quantitative and qualitative assessment, preferably in tandem. However studies that employ combined research design are rare or non-existent. Interdisciplinary multi-method investigations and analyses are called for in order to unravel mechanisms whereby social capital and mental health might be meaningfully associated.},

  year = {2006},
  abstract = {The ALNAP Review of Humanitarian Action has been monitoring the quality of evaluations of humanitarian action for the past five years. The positive news is that evaluations have become more deeply ingrained in the humanitarian sector. The not-so-good news is that the quality of the evaluations themselves still leaves much to be desired. The development of better evaluations is not just an end in itself: high-quality evaluations should have a positive effect on improving learning, accountability and performance in the sector. When the Joint Evaluation of Emergency Assistance to Rwanda was undertaken in 1995, there were no manuals, guidelines or good practice notes to follow on evaluating humanitarian action. Since then, some helpful materials have been published notably Evaluating Humanitarian Assistance Programmes in Complex Emergencies (Hallam, 1998) and Guidance for Evaluating Humanitarian Assistance in Complex Emergencies (OECD-DAC, 1999). The first of these texts was aimed at evaluators, while the second was intended for commissioning agencies. This new ALNAP guide builds on the achievement of both publications by providing a framework designed to assist with the interpretation of key DAC criteria within a specifically humanitarian context. This will be of value to both evaluators and evaluation managers alike. Evaluation teams in the field piloted draft versions of this guide, and the practical lessons learned from those experiences have been incorporated into this final version. I believe that this process has helped to create a guide that is user-friendly and will be an excellent tool for designers of evaluations and for the teams on the ground. Alongside other activities to improve evaluation, such as the ALNAP meta-evaluation and ALNAP evaluation training modules, this guide signals how far the evaluation community has come in pursuing quality in evaluation as a means of improving humanitarian performance. With other recent initiatives on evaluation quality and standards by both DAC and the UN, there are good grounds for expecting further improvements in the future.},

It summarises what health economists see as the challenges of evaluating complex interventions, and their suggested solutions. We then use examples of programme theory from a recent realist review of shared care for chronic conditions to illustrate two ways in which realist evaluations might better capture the resource requirements and resource consequences of programmes, and thereby produce explanations of how they are linked to outcomes (i.e. explanations of cost-effectiveness).},

This approach is considered especially suitable for complex interventions. We question this assumption and argue that ToC's focus on cause\textendash effect logic and intended out- comes does not do justice to the recursive nature of complex interventions such as advocacy. Supported by our work as evaluators, and specifically our case study of an advocacy program on child rights, we illustrate how advocacy evolves through recursive interactions, with outcomes that are emergent rather than predictable. We propose putting ``practices of change'' at the center by emphasizing human interactions, using the analytical lenses of strategies as practice and recursive- ness. This provides room for emergent outcomes and implies a different use of ToC. In this article, we make a clear distinction between theoretical reality models and the real world of practices.

these ingredients are combined - the recipe - to produce a given outcome).
However, both rely on the quality of mechanistic within-case explanation,
align with set theory about case membership and make asymmetric causal
claims related to necessary and/or sufficient conditions (Beach and
Pedersen, 2016). In this article, we, therefore, use the term generative

help illustrate that there was no 'one size fits all' answer and there are

a number of coalition attributes which, although they do not ensure
success, may indicate whether a coalition with these attributes might be a
'better bet' than those without them. The analysis also indicated that
predicting lack of progress can be as difficult as predicting relative
success - that is, there is no one explanation for relative failure

"Making a claim about an outcome a programme team believes
it has influenced is highly political. In process tracing, evaluation
stakeholders select observed outcomes ex post. When teams are enabled to
choose their own outcome, there is typically an incentive to select the
highest level of outcome they can to justify the high level of effort
process tracing requires. In JATRA, this meant that the team evaluated a
mechanism with six causal pathways and as many as 35 steps. With a
partner-led approach, teams also had incentives to be light on considering
rival explanations for changes they observed. So, teams need critical
friends to help prompt critical thinking regarding what else contributed
to or may explain the change they observed and counter confirmation bias"

processes. Before the evaluation, the GSAM team had a single-pathway
process map that described what should have influenced district

realized there were at least four different pathways to the same outcome.
Getting diverse perspectives in the room to figure out what had actually
happened and for different actors to explain their reasoning to others was
extremely helpful in gaining consensus, as well as making causal chains
more testable and robust (Aston, 2017" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/S2EDJN4W?page=11}{Aston et al

"Interpreted as a normative model, a cognitive map
makes no claims to reflect accurately how a person deduces new beliefs

cognitive map claims to indicate how a person actually does perform

"The total effect of point A on point B is the sum of
the indirect effects of all the paths from A to B. If all such indirect

then the sum is indeterminate." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PLRJL8HE?page=11}{Axelrod

``It is shown how a person might use his cognitive map
to derive explanations of the past, make predictions for the future, and
choose policies in the present.'' Cognitive maps can be normative or
empirical. The rules are intended to be rational, so one could naively
expect people to actually make the choices which they ought to make. The
factors or concepts are treated as variables, and the "causal assertions"
are treated as relationships between the variables. The approach treads a
fine line between treating the links as facts about the world and as facts
about what someone thinks about the world. All the examples given of types
of concept (continuous, ordinal, dichotomous) are what we call
``semi-quantitative''. A special type of concept is a utility variable, e.g.
benefit for the actor. Links or arrows can be positive (``augments'') or
negative (``inhibits''). Establishes what are by now well-established rules
for causal maps. Shows how to combine the effects of a longer path into a
single effect. The indirect effect of a path is negative if and only if it
has an odd number of negative sections. A map is ``imbalanced'' if there is
a pair of paths with opposite direct effects, and otherwise balanced.
Explicitly calculates the total effect as the sum of indirect effects.
Inference rules: uses the notion of ``utility variables'' to conclude that
those policies which have a positive total effect on utility should be
adopted, and otherwise rejected, in particular by producing a sub-map
including all and only the paths leading to utility variables. Also shows
how to make predictions and explanations, and answer strategic questions
(what would happen if the map was changed in some way)? Also discusses
cycles, positive and negative feedback etc. Discusses cognitive maps which
model with rational numbers, but also promotes the advantages of simpler
maps with links which can be only positive or negative.},

"Third, the derived cognitive map should be closely tied

relevant intervening concepts should all be included in the cognitive map
of a decision maker. Moreover, the evaluative theory of decision making

panel of judges to estimate the causal linkages asserted by each of these
actors, since documentary analysis is impractical for such a variety of
actors in a quickly emerging field. He also used his panel of judges, as
Roberts did, to get a consensus judgment about the causal links that
actually exist among the relevant variables. The principal question of
Hart's empirical study is what might be called the sociological problem:
how do the objective char\- acteristics of an actor affect the actor's
cognitive map?" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PYGR2SGG?page=16}{Axelrod

This is the first chapter in the book. Uses the term
"cognitive map" but all these maps are explicitly causal. "This is a book
about how people make decisions and how they can make better decisions".
The task is to encode public assertions and behaviour, not private
beliefs. Analyses how policy interventions can influence valued goals and
how to cope with relatively complicated sets of causal information. Aim of
establishing a (better) formalised system for decision problems. Gives our
consensus definition of causal map (points joined by arrows which encode
causality), calling it a cognitive map. Arrows encode positive or negative
links. "the cognitive map would have to be derivable from whatever
materials are left behind in the normal course of a decision-making
process." But also discusses gathering data via interview and
questionnaire. Explicitly discusses inference rules. A map has to be
amenable to evaluation - to check it against reality. Maps have to be
coded in a reliable and accurate way. Claims interrater reliability
similar to that for quantitative studies. The book presents five empirical
studies, modelling actual decision problems which are tested against
reality in various ways, including making predictions and suggesting
interventions. One of these compares maps of the same area from different
sources and discusses how background variables like nationality are
related to differences in the maps.}

  abstract = {Research methods with roots in complexity science are increasingly pop\- ular in social research. However, they are not widespread and have potential to deliver value more fully and consistently to social research and methodology. One reason for this is that methods are often used alone, or only with traditional social research methods. We attempt to support and catalyse the use of complexity-framed methods in combina\- tion in social research, by systematically reviewing which methods framed in the language of complexity (not including traditional social research methods) have been combined, how, and why. We do this to make clear the state-of-the-art of combinations and to consider gaps and potential new combinations. We find many examples of different methods used together, with simulation methods well-represented. Most examples appear in recent years despite the methods, and interest in complexity, being around much longer. We identify four types of combination, seven purposes, and consider future directions.},

We explore how they understand, use and approach complexity, and consider the implications for evaluation research and practice. Findings reveal understandings of complexity arising from contextual factors, scale-related issues and perceptions of unpredictability. The evidence indicates terminological and analogical use of complexity and its concepts by policy evaluators, but limited evidence of its literal use. Priorities for the future include framing complexity more pragmatically and as an opportunity not a cost. Communicating this up the policy hierarchy is the key to progressing complexity-appropriate evaluation \textendash{} this can be enabled by strengthening links between policy evaluation and academic communities.},

Participatory Systems Mapping involves the production of a causal map of a system by a diverse set of stakeholders. The map, once refined and validated, can be analysed and used in a variety of ways in an evaluation or in evaluation planning. The analysis approach combines network analysis with subjective information from stakeholders. We suggest Participatory Systems Mapping shows great potential to offer value to evaluators due to the unique insights it offers, the relative ease of its use, and its complementarity with existing evaluation approaches and methods.},

Food security is deter-mined by a huge range of factors over many scales ranging from global climate and water to individuals' food choices and waste behaviours. Food security policy decision-makers need to take account of these factors and their interdependencies using available data and experts judgements. Dy-namic Bayesian networks are powerful models that are able to capture the dependencies between variables and combine data with expert opinion in a rigorous fashion as they develop over time. They have been shown to be appropriate for various types of decision support; however their applica-tion to food security policy is novel. Here we design a Dynamic Bayesian network approach to provide decision support for food security as associ-ated with potential instabilities within the sugar industry.}

This chapter contributes to the literature by identifying behavioral mechanisms generated through engagement with climate-resilient agriculture interventions within a larger livelihood project in Ethiopia. It works through the steps that enabled the study to unpack the black box between the climate-smart interventions and the outcome of crop production. The first step was a matching-based sampling design, following households over 3 years with six biannual surveys, and setting up a quasi-experimental evaluation setting. The second step used the data generated from the surveys in difference-in-difference models to assess the impact of the intervention on crop production. Third, to gain insight into the mechanisms at work, Focus Group Discussions (FGD) were conducted with smallholder farmer project beneficiaries. The FGDs revealed what the beneficiaries themselves considered the key mechanisms generated from the intervention, thus forming the bridge between the interventions and outcome. The result was an evaluation design enabling deeper insight into attribution claims. The findings offered novel insights for policymakers about how the climate-resilient interventions worked for the people themselves and shedding light on the inner workings of the climate-smart technologies. Finally, they provided key stakeholders (commissioning agency and implementing organizations) with a powerful means by which to learn about the last project, so to better plan for the next iteration and improve the climate resilience of smallholder farmers.}

We show empirically that the distribution of consumption expenditures across households is, within cohorts, closer to log normal than the distribution of income. We explain this empirical result by showing that the logic of Gibrat's law applies not to total income, but to permanent income and to marginal utility.},

  abstract = {The article contends that an important but overlooked explanation for the European Union's resilience in the past decade in the face of several existential crises has been the informal instrumental leadership roles played by EU institutional actors collaborating with each other. In this article, a theoretical framework is developed that can explain why EU governments, facing a crisis, would choose to informally delegate leadership tasks to a set of EU institutional actors. A three-part mechanism of collaborative instrumental leadership provided by institutions is devised that explains why governments informally delegate leadership tasks to EU institutions, and the effects of this informal delegation. The core of the article is a process-tracing case study that explores how collaborative instrumental leadership actually works. The case selected is the British renegotiation of their terms of membership in 2015\textendash 2016. While the case has become more-or-less forgotten because the shock `no' vote in the June 2016 Brexit referendum made its terms moot, the deal included quite exceptional reform proposals in which the EU bent over backwards to accommodate the United Kingdom, perhaps even going beyond the bounds of the EU Treaties themselves in the issue of immigration. Given this, analysing how collaborative instrumental leadership supplied by institutions contributed to producing the ambitious deal can shed light on the processes whereby intractable problems in the EU have been solved in the past decade.},

Probabilities can be estimated on the basis of empirical frequencies, but such data are often unavailable for most mechanisms that are objects of evaluation. Subjective probability elicitation techniques are well established in other fields and potentially applicable, but they present potential challenges and might not always be feasible. We introduce the community to a third way: simulated probabilities. We provide proof of concept that simulation can be used to estimate probabilities in diagnostic evaluation and illustrate our case with an application to health policy.},

Whether statements can be so depends on the potential availability of the relevant evidence (e.g., no evidence exists that can prove or disprove the existence of God, but good quality evidence is potentially available in many other cases). The Bayes formula can be used to measure the extent to which a given set of empirical observations supports or weakens the belief that a causal mechanism exists. With this approach, confidence in the existence of a mechanism is increased or decreased through a process that can be open, transparent, and shared with the public or groups of stakeholders, reducing cognitive biases, and improving internal validity and consensus around the existence of given mechanisms. The approach is showcased in the evaluation of a learning partnership whereby a knowledge product released by a research organization influenced policy at the municipal level.},

This article presents a rigorous quali-quantitative approach to establish the validity of contribution claims in impact evaluation, with explicit criteria to guide evaluators in data collection and in measuring confidence in their findings. Coined `Contribution Tracing', the approach is inspired by the principles of Process Tracing and Bayesian Updating, and attempts to make these accessible, relevant and applicable by evaluators.

Results indicate an overwhelming presence of PTSD - 82\%, depression, 80\%, anxiety 76\% and poor social functioning 72\%. The strongest predictor for all the above psychopathology was that of severe and multiple trauma. Torture and loss of loved ones were the most damaging traumas, and in particular, the witnessing of atrocities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).},

(Bene 2013:12)"Whether or not these interventions did actually increase the targeted communities' resilience is not discussed in their analysis." (Bene 2013:12)"Measuring resilience by estimating the costs* it takes to go through a shock is not new in itself. A few years ago, Michael Carter and his colleagues had adopted a similar approach. In their 2007 paper these authors explore the way households in Honduras and in Ethiopia responded to two distinct disasters: Hurricane Mitch in Honduras in 1998 and the 1998-2000 drought in Ethiopia. Carter and his colleagues were not interested in resilience per se (although they mention the term in passing in several places in the paper); they were interested in determining whether a disaster can be so detrimental that it `pushes down' households below a critical asset level under which these households are not able to recover (what they call the `poverty trap' threshold). In Carter's words: `...what are the longer-term effects of shocks on households and their livelihoods? Are households able to quickly re-establish their livelihoods and the assets needed to support them, or is recovery a slow, drawn-out process, especially for poorer households who may be less able to leverage the resources needed to rebuild? Indeed, is there a ``poverty trap'' from which households can rarely recover...' (Carter et al. 2007: 836)" (Bene 2013:12)and the implicit coefficients of 1 for each of these costs also begs a question (note on p.12)"In other words, the poor have very little to lose (which explains why the richer in these communities are likely to lose more \textendash{} in absolute terms), but that `very little' is actually a larger share of the poor's initial assets.

(Bene 2013:15)"The trickiest is probably the ecological costs* induced by a shock and the costs of coping strategies and/or (mal)adaptations that are adopted by households and communities as part of their attempts to bounce back from this shock (Eriksen et al. 2011).

(Bene 2013:11)"as the rest of this paper will make clear, resilience is
not simply about economics or financial costs, it is also about social,
psychological, or ecological `costs'. To make this important distinction

in the same way as they aren't disaster-specific ... (note on p.12)"The
lower the resilience costs*, the more resilient the system is (to a given
shock)." (Bene 2013:12)"Recently Venton and her colleagues (2012) also
proposed to measure the `costs of resilience'. Their objective however was
not to establish a way to quantify resilience, but to get a sense of how
much it costs (to donors) to build resilience and whether resilience
interventions are more cost-effective than conventional humanitarian
interventions." (Bene 2013:12)"Whether or not these interventions did
actually increase the targeted communities' resilience is not discussed in
their analysis." (Bene 2013:12)"Measuring resilience by estimating the
costs* it takes to go through a shock is not new in itself. A few years
ago, Michael Carter and his colleagues had adopted a similar approach. In
their 2007 paper these authors explore the way households in Honduras and
in Ethiopia responded to two distinct disasters: Hurricane Mitch in
Honduras in 1998 and the 1998-2000 drought in Ethiopia. Carter and his
colleagues were not interested in resilience per se (although they mention
the term in passing in several places in the paper); they were interested
in determining whether a disaster can be so detrimental that it `pushes
down' households below a critical asset level under which these households
are not able to recover (what they call the `poverty trap' threshold). In
Carter's words: `...what are the longer-term effects of shocks on
households and their livelihoods? Are households able to quickly
re-establish their livelihoods and the assets needed to support them, or
is recovery a slow, drawn-out process, especially for poorer households
who may be less able to leverage the resources needed to rebuild? Indeed,
is there a ``poverty trap'' from which households can rarely recover...'
(Carter et al. 2007: 836)" (Bene 2013:12)and the implicit coefficients of
1 for each of these costs also begs a question (note on p.12)"In other
words, the poor have very little to lose (which explains why the richer in
these communities are likely to lose more \textendash{} in absolute terms), but that

(Bene 2013:12)"Measuring resilience by estimating the costs* it takes to
go through a shock is not new in itself. A few years ago, Michael Carter
and his colleagues had adopted a similar approach. In their 2007 paper
these authors explore the way households in Honduras and in Ethiopia
responded to two distinct disasters: Hurricane Mitch in Honduras in 1998
and the 1998-2000 drought in Ethiopia. Carter and his colleagues were not
interested in resilience per se (although they mention the term in passing
in several places in the paper); they were interested in determining
whether a disaster can be so detrimental that it 'pushes down' households
below a critical asset level under which these households are not able to
recover (what they call the 'poverty trap' threshold). In Carter's words:
'...what are the longer-term effects of shocks on households and their
livelihoods? Are households able to quickly re-establish their livelihoods
and the assets needed to support them, or is recovery a slow, drawn-out
process, especially for poorer households who may be less able to leverage
the resources needed to rebuild? Indeed, is there a "poverty trap" from
which households can rarely recover...' (Carter et al. 2007: 836)" (Bene
2013:12)and the implicit coefficients of 1 for each of these costs also
begs a question (note on p.12)"In other words, the poor have very little
to lose (which explains why the richer in these communities are likely to
lose more - in absolute terms), but that 'very little' is actually a
larger share of the poor's initial assets. On Fig. 2 this translates by
the fact that |A| \textbackslash textgreater |B| but A/A* Bene 2013:13)"the poorer are
slower at rebuilding their asset-base than the richer," (Bene
2013:13)"resilience is not simply about change (loss) in assets, it is
also about individual's psychological stress following a disaster" (Bene
2013:14)"(i) Costs of anticipation and preparedness activities, such as
the building of a dike" (Bene 2013:14)"(ii) Impact costs*, including the
tangible destruction of individual and collective assets and
infrastructure, but also other costs* such as the psychological stress
engendered at individual and collective level by the shock;" (Bene
2013:14)"(iii) Costs* of recovery activities, including rebuilding of
destructed assets and infrastructures at household, community or system
levels (e.g. water distribution system), but also the engagement in any
coping strategies such as, e.g., asset selling or borrowing money from the
local money lender to replace the destroyed assets. This component also
includes humanitarian assistance (if any)." (Bene 2013:14)how to
distinguish costs of destruction and yet also costs of rebuilding? (note
on p.14)"Likewise, coping strategy indicators (CSI) such as these
developed by Maxwell and Caldwell (2008) may not 'measure' the exact
effect of a given shock on nutrition and food security (as these actual
effects would be measurable only later), but they have been widely
accepted as good and reliable 'status indicators' of the impact of a shock
on people's nutrition and food security" (Bene 2013:15)"As far as
psychological costs* are concerned, there are specific indexes that can be
used such as the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)." (Bene
2013:15)"The trickiest is probably the ecological costs* induced by a
shock and the costs of coping strategies and/or (mal)adaptations that are
adopted by households and communities as part of their attempts to bounce
back from this shock (Eriksen et al. 2011). One of the difficulties lies
in that those impacts may not be visible or measurable immediately. Y"

." (Bene 2013:17)"What we are evaluating is only the short term direct
costs* of these (see subsection 2.3. just below)." (Bene 2013:17)"This
issue of time boundary (or time horizon) is not specific to our framework.
It is a well-known issue in cost-benefit analysis literature, recognized
by both academics (e.g. Fuguitt 1999) and practitioners (WHO 2006)." (Bene
2013:17)"Though still rare, high frequency measurement (e.g. monthly or
bimonthly surveys) are fundamental for understanding resilience dynamics
at the household level" (Bene 2013:18)\textemdash\textemdash\textemdash -Extracted Annotations (Mon 06

(Bene 2013:1) "reviewing some of the most recently published and grey
literature on resilience in relation to food security" (Bene 2013:3)
"Second it proposes a new framework" (Bene 2013:3) "main postulate of this
framework is that the `costs of resilience' (that is, the different
ex-ante and ex-post investments, losses, sacrifices, and costs that people
have to undertake at individual and collective levels to `go through' a
shock or an adverse event) provide an appropriate and independent metric
to measure resilience across scales and dimensions." (Bene 2013:3) xi so
if you are going to cash this out in terms of individual HH indicators,
how can you be sure of regular, even linear connections? (note on p.3)
"might help break the silos" (Bene 2013:6) "usually adopt an inductive
approach whereby particular households and/or community characteristics"
(Bene 2013:7) "are assumed to be building blocks of resilience," (Bene
2013:7) "this inductive process leads to circular analyses where
resilience indexes are first built from an a priori identified combination
of household or community indicators, and then used to evaluate the impact
of resilience interventions on households, leading to circular (or
non-independent) analyses (Box 1)." (Bene 2013:7) "large majority of the
approaches proposed often limit their analyses at one unique level of
resilience \textendash{} usually the household level (see e.g. Ciani and Romano 2013;
Kurtz and Langworthy 2013)." (Bene 2013:8) "Box 2 A good example of an
independent measure of resilience" (Bene 2013:9) "resilience results from
the synergy and trade-offs between three core attributes: the absorptive,
the adaptive and the transformative capacities of households (or system)
under consideration" (Bene 2013:10) "When the absorptive capacity is
exceeded, however, the individual will then exercise their adaptive
resilience." (Bene 2013:10) "Every type of responses and their outcomes
(persistence, incremental adjustment or radical transformation) have
different transactional costs" (Bene 2013:10) "The key point here is to
recognise that anticipating, absorbing, accommodating, and recovering from
the effects of a hazardous event induces some costs." (Bene 2013:11) "more
resilient household (or community, or system) is one that makes less
`sacrifices' (i.e. that pay lower resilience costs*) to pass through a
given shock, than a less resilient household (or community, or system)"
(Bene 2013:11) massive question-begging - how do you know that investing
in resilience might not be to your advantage in the medium term and even
save you money/pain? (note on p.11) "the ex-ante investments made as
preparedness process (anticipation costs) the costs of destruction

including the replacement costs of what has been destroyed but also the
various costs* associated with change/adaptation, or transformation and

It argues for the need to clearly distinguish between this approach and that of levels of evidence, which is linked to data collection and processing methods (e.g. single case observations, difference methods, randomized controlled trials\textbackslash ldots).

Whilst the need for an African evaluation approach has been well established in the literature, there are still significant gaps in a proactive response. One of these gaps is the role of indigenous knowledge systems in these evaluation approaches. Indigenous knowledge systems have been a priority research area for decades, often in fields of science and technology, education and in research methods. Despite these strong overlaps with areas of interest to evaluators, there has been relatively little intersection between research on evaluation systems and that on indigenous knowledge systems. Objectives: This article brings together these two areas of research to see what lessons for African-rooted evaluation approaches emerge from the body of research on indigenous knowledge systems. Method: To do this, a scoping review was conducted, applying a thematic analysis to literature identified for inclusion in the study. Results: This study found that there is considerable scope for the evaluation sector to draw on indigenous knowledge systems research, particularly drawing on process and methodological lessons from designing studies, as well as defining power dynamics and critical systems approaches. Conclusion: This analysis can contribute to a needed debate about how to define and promote localised, contextually relevant evaluation tools and methods. It can also contribute to building a research agenda around African evaluation approaches.},

  abstract = {Applied agricultural research institutes play different roles in complex agricultural innovation processes, contributing to them with other actors. To foster learning and usable knowledge on how research actions influence such lasting innovation processes, there is a need to identify the causal mechanisms linking these actions and the effects of the changes they enable. A participatory, theory-driven, ex-post evaluation method, ImpresS, was developed by the French Agricultural Research Center for International Development (Cirad). ImpresS reconstructs the innovation history and its impact pathway by analyzing behavioral mechanisms linked to stakeholders' individual reactions and responses, and underlying process mechanisms at a group level. ImpresS relies on iterative updating and refinement and on triangulating data sources and collection methods to ensure internal validity and to increase credibility by enabling different actors to express their viewpoints. Drawing on an in-depth case study, we discuss how ImpresS makes it possible to draw robust conclusions on causal mechanisms while posing challenges linked to the group dynamics and power imbalances commonly encountered in participatory methods. As demonstrated by the case study, ImpresS generates policy-relevant knowledge for future research projects. It also demonstrates how research actions can help coconstruct lasting dynamics that can survive fluctuating institutional support. Distinguishing between behavioral and process mechanisms benefits knowledge use as it makes it possible to disentangle the conditions that trigger changes in a given context while generating research questions concerning the external validity of mechanism hypotheses.},

  abstract = {Causality was at the center of the early history of Structural Equation Models (SEMs) which continue to serve as the most popular approach to causal analysis in the social sciences. Through decades of development critics and defenses of the capability of SEMs to support causal inference have accumulated. A variety of misunderstandings and myths about the nature of SEMs and their role in causal analysis have emerged and their repetition has led some to believe they are true. Our paper is organized by presenting eight myths about causality and SEMs in the hope that this will lead to a more accurate understanding. More specifically, the eight myths are: (1) SEMs aim to establish causal relations from associations alone, (2) SEMs and regression are essentially equivalent, (3) No causation without manipulation, (4) SEMs are not equipped to handle nonlinear causal relationships, (5) A potential outcome framework is more principled than SEMs, (6) SEMs are not applicable to experiments with randomized treatments, (7) Mediation analysis in SEMs is inherently noncausal, and (8) SEMs do not test any major part of the theory against the data. We present the facts that dispell these myths, describe what SEMs can and cannot do, and briefly present our critique of current practice using SEMs. We conclude that the current capabilities of SEMs to formalize and implement causal inference tasks are indispensible; its potential to do more is even greater.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have emphasized the merits of search processes that lack overarching objectives, instead promoting divergence by rewarding behavioral novelty. While this less objective search paradigm is more open-ended and divergent, it still differs significantly from nature's mechanism of divergence. Rather than measuring novelty explicitly, nature is guided by a single, fundamental constraint: survive long enough to reproduce. Surprisingly, this simple constraint produces both complexity and diversity in a continual process unparalleled by any algorithm to date. Inspired by the relative simplicity of open-endedness in nature in comparison to recent non-objective algorithms, this paper investigates the extent to which interactions between two coevolving populations, both subject to their own constraint, or minimal criterion, can produce results that are both functional and diverse even without any behavior characterization or novelty archive. To test this new approach, a novel maze navigation domain is introduced wherein evolved agents must learn to navigate mazes whose structures are simultaneously coevolving and increasing in complexity. The result is a broad range of maze topologies and successful agent trajectories in a single run, thereby suggesting the viability of minimal criterion coevolution as a new approach to non-objective search and a step towards genuinely open-ended algorithms.},

  abstract = {The concept of data saturation, defined as `information redundancy' or the point at which no new themes or codes `emerge' from data, is widely referenced in thematic analysis (TA) research in sport and exercise, and beyond. Several researchers have sought to `operationalise' data saturation and provide concrete guidance on how many interviews, or focus groups, are enough to achieve some degree of data saturation in TA research. Our disagreement with such attempts to `capture' data saturation for TA led us to this commentary. Here, we contribute to critical discussions of the saturation concept in qualitative research by interrogating the assumptions around the practice and procedures of TA that inform these data saturation `experiments', and the conceptualisation of saturation as information redundancy. We argue that although the concepts of data-, thematic- or code-saturation, and even meaning-saturation, are coherent with the neo-positivist, discovery-oriented, meaning excavation project of coding reliability types of TA, they are not consistent with the values and assumptions of reflexive TA. We encourage sport and exercise and other researchers using reflexive TA to dwell with uncertainty and recognise that meaning is generated through interpretation of, not excavated from, data, and therefore judgements about `how many' data items, and when to stop data collection, are inescapably situated and subjective, and cannot be determined (wholly) in advance of analysis.},

While most theorists use figures of some kind, few if any have formal training, or guiding rules or principles for the representation of theory. This has often led to poor visualization efforts, and the visual culture of sociology continues to lag behind the natural sciences. The intent of this paper is to serve as a practical and empirically aided guide for social theorists, by providing insights surrounding the cognitive and perceptual properties of certain elements and figures. Through these properties we identify four major problems in theory visualization: vagueness, reduction, unwanted spatial inferences and unwanted metaphorical inferences. We offer solutions to these problems, and to improving theory visualization more generally. Our hope is that this paper will serve as a resource for more thoughtful and informed visualization for practicing social theorists.},

  author = {Brightman, Jenny},
  year = {2003},
  journal = {IOE Conference},
  number = {May},
  pages = {1--14},
  abstract = {Introduction The purpose of this paper is to outline and discuss the characteristics and use of four different methods for " mapping " qualitative data. The methods discussed are mind mapping (developed primarily by Tony Buzan. Buzan with Buzan 1993)), concept mapping (developed primarily by Joseph Novak. Novak \& Gowan 1984), cognitive mapping (developed primarily by Colin Eden -with David Sims and Sue Jones and later with Fran Ackermann. Eden, Jones, \& Sims 1979, Ackermann et al 1992, Eden \& Ackermann 1998) and dialog mapping (developed by Jeff Conklin. Conklin 2003). Each of these methods provides a framework for structuring qualitative data (ideas). While there are some similarities between the four methods each has its own distinctive characteristics. These characteristics are described in detail, with a short illustration and sample map. The characteristics are then summarized and contrasted at the end of the paper. Any one of these methods might be of interest and of use to individuals and groups of researchers who either need to structure their own thinking about a project or who wish to use one of the methods to gain new insights into their research data. Which method you use to map your data depends on what you are trying to achieve. Qualitative data analysis (QDA) context Qualitative data analysis texts and journals (see note 1) show a focus on the " code and retrieve " approach for structuring and analyzing qualitative data. These methods tend to form the main body of work in studies using qualitative data. A "typical" QDA project might involve a series of interviews or focus groups from which information is recorded and transcribed and then "coded" into various categories. The researcher's own notes, recorded as linear text, may also be added to the repository of data and coded using a particular coding approach (such as open coding, axial coding or selective coding). Conclusions are then drawn from and theories built around the coded data. Mapping the structure of ideas, be they the researcher's ideas about a project or the research subjects' ideas is generally a small part of such QDA studies. In talking about causal mapping Miles and Hubermann observe that: " the conventional view is that qualitative studies are only good for exploratory forays, for developing hypotheses -and that strong explanations, including causal attribution, can be derived only through quantitative studies " (Miles \& Hubermann. 1994). The result of this view is that researchers do not appear to explore the use of mapping methods (particularly causal ones), either for their own use or as part of their study. There are, however, several well-established ideas mapping methods for qualitative data structuring (QDS) -not all of which are causal methods. These methods offer different frameworks for organizing ideas and providing insight into qualitative data. As well as being of use to the researcher in organizing his/ her own thinking, ideas mapping can be used to express and explore the relationship between the different variables in the data, to explore the causal and other relationships expressed in the data, and highlight actions and their consequences. The four QDS methods discussed here developed in different fields of study. The mind mapping technique was developed and popularized primarily by Tony Buzan, in the UK, who started his career at the Daily Telegraph Newspaper, in London. As an undergraduate at the University of British Columbia, studying psychology, English, mathematics and general science he became absorbed by questions which related to how we learn, the nature of thinking and the best techniques for creative thinking. This led to further studying of " psychology, the neuro-pathology of the brain, semantics, neuro-linguistics, information theory, memory and mnemonic techniques, perception, creative thinking and the general sciences " . (Buzan with Buzan 1993). In 1971 he started to write about his ideas on mind mapping and radiant thinking, " Use your head " was published in 1974.},

  abstract = {One aim of development volunteer services is to foster positive attitudes in participants toward those they encounter in their host countries. However, the psychological mechanisms underlying such attitude change remain underexplored. This is true despite intergroup contact theory proposing that contact between groups causes more positive intergroup attitudes through the mechanism of increased mutual knowledge, improved perspective-taking, and higher levels of empathy. A theory-based multi-method evaluation of the German weltw\"arts development volunteer service included a quasi-experimental component to address the question of whether and how development volunteering contributes to such attitude change. Part of this component was the specification of a multiple-mediator model based on intergroup contact theory to investigate the mechanism that brings about attitude change at a critical juncture of the program theory. The evaluation observed a highly significant small-to-medium-sized effect of development volunteering on intergroup attitudes ({$\beta$} =.19). The analysis revealed that this effect was fully mediated by changes in the mediational pathways of knowledge, perspective-taking, and empathy. The mediation analysis thereby lent strong support to the validity of causal hypotheses derived from intergroup contact theory in the context of development volunteering. It also substantially increased the explanatory strength, utility, and policy relevance of the evaluation. Based on these evaluation findings, development volunteer services should be designed such that they allow for the identified mechanism to fully unfold in order to increase program effectiveness. The chapter ends with a discussion of limitations and future directions concerning the use of mediation analysis in program evaluation.},

  abstract = {In order to deal with an increasingly complex world, we need ever more sophisticated computational models that can help us make decisions wisely and understand the potential consequences of choices. But creating a model requires far more than just raw data and technical skills: it requires a close collaboration between model commissioners, developers, users and reviewers. Good modelling requires its users and commissioners to understand more about the whole process, including the different kinds of purpose a model can have and the different technical bases. This paper offers a guide to the process of commissioning, developing and deploying models across a wide range of domains from public policy to science and engineering. It provides two checklists to help potential modellers, commissioners and users ensure they have considered the most significant factors that will determine success. We conclude there is a need to reinforce modelling as a discipline, so that misconstruction is less likely; to increase understanding of modelling in all domains, so that the misuse of models is reduced; and to bring commissioners closer to modelling, so that the results are more useful.},

  abstract = {What kinds of evidence reliably support predictions of effectiveness for health and social care interventions? There is increasing reliance, not only for health care policy and practice but also for more general social and economic policy deliberation, on evidence that comes from studies whose basic logic is that of JS Mill's method of difference. These include randomized controlled trials, case-control studies, cohort studies, and some uses of causal Bayes nets and counterfactual-licensing models like ones commonly developed in econometrics. The topic of this paper is the 'external validity' of causal conclusions from these kinds of studies. We shall argue two claims. Claim, negative: external validity is the wrong idea; claim, positive: 'capacities' are almost always the right idea, if there is a right idea to be had. If we are right about these claims, it makes big problems for policy decisions. Many advice guides for grading policy predictions give top grades to a proposed policy if it has two good Mill's-method-of difference studies that support it. But if capacities are to serve as the conduit for support from a method-of-difference study to an effectiveness prediction, much more evidence, and much different in kind, is required. We will illustrate the complexities involved with the case of multisystemic therapy, an internationally adopted intervention to try to diminish antisocial behaviour in young people.}

  abstract = {Philosophers of science have had little to say about `middle-range theory' although much of what is done in science and of what drives its successes falls under that label. These lectures aim to spark an interest in the topic and to lay groundwork for further research on it. `Middle' in `middle range' is with respect to the level both of abstraction and generality. Much middle-range theory is about things that come under the label `mechanism'. The lectures explore three different kinds of mechanism: structural mechanisms or underlying systems that afford causal pathways; causal-chain mechanisms that are represented in what in policy contexts are called `theories of change' and for which I give an extended account following the causal process theory of Wesley Salmon; and middlerange-law mechanisms like those discussed by Jon Elster, which I claim are \textendash{} and rightly are \textendash rampant throughout the social sciences. The theory of the democratic peace, that democracies do not go to war with democracies, serves as a running example. The discussions build up to the start of, first, an argument that reliability in social (and natural) science depends not so much on evidence than it does on the support of a virtuous tangle of practices (without which there couldn't even be evidence), and second, a defence of a community-practice centred instrumentalist understanding of many of the central basic principles that we use (often successfully) in social (and in natural) science for explanation, prediction and evaluation.},

  abstract = {Analytical techniques are generally inadequate for dealing with causal interrelationships among a set of individual and social concepts. Usually, causal maps are used to cope with this type of interrelationships. However, the classical view of causal maps is based on an intuitive view with ad hoc rules and no precise semantics of the primitive concepts, nor a sound formal treatment of relations between concepts. In this paper, we solve this problem by proposing a formal model for causal maps with a precise semantics based on relation algebra and the software tool, CM-RELVIEW, in which it has been implemented. Then, we investigate the issue of using this tool in multiagent environments by explaining through different examples how and why this tool is useful for the following aspects: 1) the reasoning on agents' subjective views, 2) the qualitative distributed decision making, and 3) the organization of agents considered as a holistic approach. For each of these aspects, we focus on the computational mechanisms developed within CM-RELVIEW to support it.},

  abstract = {Logical Framework Analysis (Logframe) and its variants as a required method for planning and monitoring illustrate how procedures can reinforce relationships of power and control. With origins in management practices for infrastructure projects, the logframe embodies a linear logic associated with things rather than people, with simple and controlled conditions, and with closed systems. It has what has been called vertical and horizontal logic, required in a matrix form. The vertical logic down the matrix is concerned with ends and means -with objectives, goals and purposes, then outputs, then the activities intended to achieve the outputs. The horizontal logic across the matrix is from narrative summary to objectively verifiable indicators and means of verification. A final vertical column is used to identify assumptions about the external environment that enable or hinder the realization of activities, outputs and purpose. In many instances, in its time, the logframe has served well to focus attention on the links between activities and their intended effects, and, hence, to sharpen interventions. For example, at the UK Department for International Development (DFID), the logframe was found to be useful in shifting the focus from technology toward people, and in demanding evidence of the connections between proposed activities and their impacts on poverty. This signals that certain procedures have their time and place; but changing conditions may require their reassessment and replacement. In its heyday, the logframe gave rise to a small army of practitioners who trained others in the technique, and then helped them to carry it out. Some agencies have now abandoned it or do not require it -although there are indications that a new generation of policy makers are favouring it as a requirement for funding proposals. Most critics of the logframe recognize the value of thinking through some of the vertical logic of a project, but find the experience of using it costly and disempowering. Donor-induced logframe meetings rarely include poor people, yet participatory poverty assessments present much evidence that the priorities of poor people often differ from those perceived by outsiders and local elites. Often, expatriates dominate and the language is English. The idea in ZOPP (Ziel-Orienterte Projekt Planung), a close relative of the logframe developed by the German aid agency Deutsche Gesellschaft for Technische Zusammenarbeit, is that stakeholders should brainstorm until they agree on one single core problem. This involves a reductionism that flies in the face of multiple and changing realities. Logframe analysis more generally inhibits process and participation and is often experienced as rigid and constraining. When the actual and sensible activities being undertaken differ from those in the frame, reporting can become a nightmare, and the eventual external 'purpose-to-outcome' evaluation can be perceived as a looming threat rather than an opportunity to learn and do better.}

In June 2019, we conducted a cross-sectional survey using mixed methods to investigate how inhabitants of Hanoi perceive and respond to the risk of mosquito-borne diseases (MBD). A total of 117 participants recruited using a stratified random sampling method were interviewed in three districts of Hanoi. Knowledge and practices (KP) regarding MBDs were assessed using a pre-tested questionnaire. Inferential statistics were used to identify factors associated with KP scores and describe the relationship between variables. Additionally, a ``risk-mapping'' exercise was conducted in a subsample through semi-structured interviews and analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively using the System Effects platform. Factors significantly associated with knowledge scores were education and family history of MBDs. While knowledge and practice scores were found to be positively correlated in the statistical analysis, this was not corroborated by our observations on the field. The results also revealed gaps in knowledge about MBDs and vectors and highlighted a general feeling of powerlessness which prevented the adoption of protective behaviors. Therefore, educational interventions which provide concrete tools to empower communities should have a positive impact on improving vector control.},

  abstract = {Past research on aid and growth is flawed because it typically examines the impact of aggregate aid on growth over a short period, usually four years, while significant portions of aid are unlikely to affect growth in such a brief time. We divide aid into three categories: (1) emergency and humanitarian aid (likely to be negatively correlated with growth); (2) aid that affects growth only over the long term, if at all, such as aid to support democracy, the environment, health, or education (likely to have no relationship to growth over four years); and (3) aid that plausibly could stimulate growth in four years, including budget and balance of payments support, investments in infrastructure, and aid for productive sectors such as agriculture and industry. Our focus is on the third group, which accounts for about 45\% of all aid flows. We find a positive, causal relationship between this short-impact aid and economic growth (with diminishing returns) over a four-year period. The impact is large: at least two-to-three times larger than in studies using aggregate aid. Even at a conservatively high discount rate, at the mean a \$1 increase in short-impact aid raises output (and income) by \$8 in present value in the typical country. From a different perspective, we find that higher-than-average short-impact aid to sub-Saharan Africa raised per capita growth rates there by about one percentage point over the growth that would have been achieved by average aid flows. The results are highly statistically significant and stand up to a demanding array of tests, including various specifications, endogeneity structures, and treatment of influential observations. The basic result does not depend crucially on a recipient's level of income or quality of institutions and policies; we find that short-impact aid causes growth, on average, regardless of these characteristics. However, we find some evidence that the impact on growth is somewhat larger in countries with stronger institutions or longer life expectancies (better health). We also find a significant negative relationship between debt repayments and growth. We make no statement on, and do not attempt to measure, any additional long-run effects of aid; four-year panel regressions are not an appropriate tool to examine those relationships.},

  abstract = {Haiti's earthquake of 12 th January 2010 killed over 220 000 people, injured 300 000, left well over one million homeless, and destroyed infrastructure, services and homes. The cost of reconstruction is estimated at US\$11.5 billion 1 . This happened in a country already the poorest in the western hemisphere, ranked 149 out of 182 countries on the 2009 Human Development Index, with some 78\% of its population living on under US\$2 a day, and beset by huge societal inequality and weak governance. While recognising the effects of the disaster on the whole country, this study is required to focus on the impact within urban areas, and to ask, what can be learnt for international NGOs for the next urban disaster? Several lessons emerge. A first one concerns increased urban risk globally, described by the World Bank in a new report 2 as a 'new game-changer.' If this is right, and urban risk presents something different, then agencies need to learn 'new rules of the game' in urban post disaster response. Issues of complexity, range of actors, space, the importance of commerce and trade, services, infrastructure and sheer concentrations of people require a consideration of how to operate compared to rural contexts, including collaborations (with government and the private sector), the importance of cash based programmes (in cash for work but also in supporting petty vendors and businesses), markets (working with them and not unfairly competing) and housing (considering trade offs between short term shelter and long term settlements and thinking about forms of rental). Building social and human capital is key, and in this response good programming approaches sought to do this in the relief stage, for example working with street food vendors to enhance food security. Some responses however tended to forget that cities contain readily available concentrations of skills and resources that, rather than being imported, might be found locally. Relief provided in camps sought to work through camp committees. Especially vulnerable people were often located and assisted, for example in the work of Age UK in the formation of a network of camp volunteers. The prolonged provision of services in camps however, such as water and healthcare, has been both expensive and has in some cases undermined pre-existing service providers who could not compete.},

In the current period of major innovation in quantitative tools for causal inference, this reformulation is part of a wider, parallel effort to achieve greater systematization of qualitative methods. A key point here is that these methods can add inferential leverage that is often lacking in quantitative analysis.

It is well established that DRR addresses change in risk, well-being and security including through adaptation and resilience building.

This is a multi-sectoral and inter-disciplinary field for which interpretation and consequent reactions to environmental change and migration involves technology, civil societal engagement, and political commitment. The paper presents implications for reacting to migration influenced by environmental change apparent from DRR principles of prevention, mitigation and post event response. Four operating mechanisms of DRR are also considered. They are early warning, risk management, improved communication and the use of appropriate response standards. The applicability and efficacy of these DRR principles and operating mechanisms for reacting to migration influenced by environmental change are conditioned by hazard uncertainty and potential impact. Disaster prevention or mitigation for those who move, host or stay behind involves community based risk reduction, resilience building, rights approaches, and migration as adaptation. The application of DRR to migration influenced by environmental change therefore highlights the importance of engaging localised strategies and well-being aspirations, and of knowing the limitations of humanitarian response in upholding rights and sustainable development outcomes. Whilst the development of DRR principles may analytically frame potential environmental migration responses, there are ongoing theoretical and applied challenges in this relationship. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

and Phillips (2012: 4, 34) identify a cluster of qualitative approaches
sharing a common core that `involves the specification of a theory of

strong evidence that X and Y happened in such contexts, (b) X is described
by a diverse range of stakeholders as having been a necessary cause of Y

caused Y in those contexts are independently arrived at and mutually

One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

  abstract = {Causal inference goes beyond prediction by modeling the outcome of interventions and formalizing counterfactual reasoning. Instead of restricting causal conclusions to experiments, causal inference explicates the conditions under which it is possible to draw causal conclusions even from observational data. In this paper, I provide a concise introduction to the graphical approach to causal inference, which uses Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to visualize, and Structural Causal Models (SCMs) to relate probabilistic and causal relationships. Successively, we climb what Judea Pearl calls the "causal hierarchy" --- moving from association to intervention to counterfactuals. I explain how DAGs can help us reason about associations between variables as well as interventions; how the do-calculus leads to a satisfactory definition of confounding, thereby clarifying, among other things, Simpson's paradox; and how SCMs enable us to reason about what could have been. Lastly, I discuss a number of challenges in applying causal inference in practice.},

``Here,
the fundamental building block from which interventional as well as
counterfactual statements follow are Structural Causal Models (SCM);
instead of starting from potential outcomes, this approach to causal
inference sees them as being derived from SCMs'' (Dablander, 2020, p. 1)
\par
``Association
is on the most basic level, allowing us to see that two or more things are
somehow related. Importantly, we need to distinguish between marginal
associations, which look at the assocation between two variables without
taking into account other variables, and conditional associations, which
do take other variables into account. The latter are a key element of
causal inference'' (Dablander, 2020, p. 2)
\par
``Figure
6. Seeing: DAGs are used to encode conditional independencies. The first
three DAGs encode the same associations. Doing: DAGs are causal. All of
them encode distinct causal assumptions. As is easily verified with
d-separation, the first three graphs in the top row encode the same
conditional independence structure. This implies that we cannot
distinguish them using only observational data. Interpreting the edges
causally, however, we see that the DAGs have a starkly different
interpretation. The bottom row makes this apparent by showing the result
of an intervention on X. In the leftmost causal DAG, Z is on the causal
path from X to Y, and intervening on X therefore'' (Dablander, 2020, p. 5)
\par
``Using
the framework of causal inference, we can be more precise and call a
causal effect of X on Y confounded if p(Y | X = x) , p(Y | do(X = x)),
which also implies that collider bias is a type of confounding''
(Dablander, 2020, p. 6)
\par
``Confounding
occured in the middle two DAGs in Figure 6, as well as in the chocolate
consumption and Nobel Laureates example. Confounding is the bane of
observational data analysis'' (Dablander, 2020, p. 6)
\par
``Observe
that more men as well as more women recover when taking the treatment (93\%
and 73\%) compared to when not taking the treatment (87\% and 69\%). And yet,
when taken together, fewer patients who took the treatment recovered (78\%)
compared to patients who did not take the treatment (83\%). This is
puzzling \textemdash{} should a doctor prescribe the treatment or not? Clearly, the
answer has important real-world ramifications. Yet Lindley and Novick
(1981) showed that there is no purely statistical criterion which allows
us to decide whether to prescribe or not prescribe the treatment''
(Dablander, 2020, p. 7)
\par
``Structural
Causal Models (SCM) relate causal and probabilistic statements. As an
example, consider the following SCM: X := {$\epsilon$}X Y := f (X, {$\epsilon$}Y ) . X directly
causes Y in a manner specified by the function f ; the noise variables {$\epsilon$}X
and {$\epsilon$}Y are assumed to be independent. In a SCM, we take each equation to
be a causal statement, and we stress this by using the assignment symbol
:= instead of the equality sign =. Note that this is in stark contrast to
standard regression models; here, we explicitly state our causal
assumptions'' (Dablander, 2020, p. 9)
\par
``Figure
10 shows that Y has a much weaker association with X (left panel) than
with Z (right panel); this is because the standard deviation of the error
{$\epsilon$}X is only a tenth of the standard deviation of the error {$\epsilon$}Z. For
prediction, therefore, Z is the more relevant variable. Predicting Y using
X X Y -4 -2 0 2 4 -6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 Predicting Y using Z Z Y -6 -4 -2 0 2 4

than Z. But does Z actually have a causal effect on Y? This is a question
about intervention, which is squarely located at the second level of the
causal hierarchy'' (Dablander, 2020, p. 10)
\par
``However,
note again that this is strictly about populations, not individuals. In
the next section, we see how SCMs allow us to reach the final level of the
causal hierarchy, moving beyond the average to define individual causal
effects'' (Dablander, 2020, p. 10)
\par
``The
dooperator, introduced above, is too weak to model counterfactuals. This
is because it operates on distributions that are defined on populations,
not on individuals. We can define an average causal effect using the
do-operator, but \textemdash{} unsurprisingly \textemdash{} it only ever refers to averages.
However, Structural Causal Models also allow counterfactual reasoning on
the level of the individual; we illustrate this with the following
example.'' (Dablander, 2020, p. 11)
\par
``Would
this particular patient have recovered more quickly if we had given him
grandma's treatment even though we did not? We denote this quantity of
interest as RT=1({$\epsilon$}1) to contrast it with the actually observed RT=0({$\epsilon$}1).
To compute this seemingly otherworldly quantity, we simply plug the value
T = 1 and {$\epsilon$}1 = 0.80 into our Structural Causal Model, which yields:
RT=1({$\epsilon$}1) = 5 - 2 + 0.80 = 3.80 . Using this, we can define the individual
causal effect of treatment T on recovery R for the first patient
as:'' (Dablander, 2020, p. 11)
\par
``may
strike you as a bit eerie to speak about different worlds'' (Dablander, 2020, p. 12)
\par
``Computing
causal effects usually requires one to condition on covariates to adjust
for confounding. Selecting the appropriate covariates is a difficult
statistical problem, however'' (Dablander, 2020, p. 12)
\par
``The
fact that directed acylic graphs do not allow feedback loops may seem to
run counter to real-life experience. In psychology, for example, it is
obvious that variables can reinforce each other, resulting in a cycle. One
may argue, however, that at a sufficiently high temporal resolution, no
system has cycles.'' (Dablander, 2020, p. 12)
\par
``Instead,
the system can be modeled as a DAG at each time unit, where X \textrightarrow{} Y at time
t and Y \textrightarrow{} X at time t + 1. Under some conditions, Structural Causal Models
can allow cyclic assignments, which leads to directed cyclic graphs (e.g.,
Spirtes, 1995). In the Structural Equation Modeling literature, such
models are known as nonrecursive Structural Equation Models (e.g., Bollen,
1989, p. 83)'' (Dablander, 2020, p. 12)
\par
``Correctly
interpreting DAGs causally requires two crucial assumptions. First, we
assumed that the DAG includes all relevant variables and their causal
relations. In practical applications, this is hard to verify, and likely
always violated to some extent. Second, we assumed that interventions are
local, that is, that intervening on one variable does not influence other
variables that are causally unrelated to the intervened variable. This is
likely violated in many applications. In psychology, for example, we
usually do have a ``fat hand''; for example, an intervention geared towards
decreasing suicidal thoughts most certainly influences other variables as
well. The extent to which this is problematic must be assessed on a case
by case basis'' (Dablander, 2020, p. 12)
\par
``Lastly,
I want to touch upon a conceptual issue which concerns the interpretation
of the do-operator for nonmanipulable causes. Recall'' (Dablander, 2020, p. 12)
\par
``Pearl
(2019a), for example, argues that one need not to worry about the
distinction between manipulable and non-manipulable causes, stating that
one could interpret the causal effect as an upper bound of an ideal
intervention which might be possible in the future. M. A. Hern\'an (2016),
on the other hand, calls for the need of ``well-defined
interventions'' (Dablander, 2020, p.

As a result, the concept of PE is ambiguous and inadequately theorized. Furthermore, no existing instrument accurately measures stakeholder participation. First, this article attempts to overcome these problems by using the works of G. Goertz (2006) and J. Gerring (1999) on concept formation and evaluation to assess current conceptualizations of PE. Second, an amended version of the framework developed by J. B. Cousins and E. Whitmore (1998) is proposed as an alternative to current conceptualizations. This amended framework is then operationalized and adapted in a participation measurement instrument. The proposed conceptualization and instrument have the potential to contribute to the production of sound empirical knowledge about evaluation and to reflections on PE practice. \textcopyright{} 2009 American Evaluation Association.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The idea that underlying, generative mechanisms give rise to causal regularities has become a guiding principle across many social and natural science disciplines. A specific form of this enquiry, realist evaluation is gaining momentum in the evaluation of complex social interventions. It focuses on 'what works, how, in which conditions and for whom' using context, mechanism and outcome configurations as opposed to asking whether an intervention 'works'. Realist evaluation can be difficult to codify and requires considerable researcher reflection and creativity. As such there is often confusion when operationalising the method in practice. This article aims to clarify and further develop the concept of mechanism in realist evaluation and in doing so aid the learning of those operationalising the methodology.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nDISCUSSION: Using a social science illustration, we argue that disaggregating the concept of mechanism into its constituent parts helps to understand the difference between the resources offered by the intervention and the ways in which this changes the reasoning of participants. This in turn helps to distinguish between a context and mechanism. The notion of mechanisms 'firing' in social science research is explored, with discussions surrounding how this may stifle researchers' realist thinking. We underline the importance of conceptualising mechanisms as operating on a continuum, rather than as an 'on/off' switch. The discussions in this article will hopefully progress and operationalise realist methods. This development is likely to occur due to the infancy of the methodology and its recent increased profile and use in social science research. The arguments we present have been tested and are explained throughout the article using a social science illustration, evidencing their usability and value.},

Most Significant Change (MSC) technique is a dialogical, story-based
technique. Its primary purpose is to facilitate program improvement by
focusing the direction of work towards explicitly valued directions and
away from less valued directions. MSC can also make a contribution to
summative evaluation through both its process and its outputs. The
technique involves a form of continuous values inquiry whereby designated
groups of stakeholders search for significant program outcomes and then
deliberate on the value of these outcomes in a systematic and transparent
manner. To date, MSC has largely been used for the evaluation of
international development programs, after having been initially developed
for the evaluation of a social development program in Bangladesh (Davies,
1996). This article provides an introduction to MSC and discusses its
potential to add to the basket of choices for evaluating programs in
developed economies. We provide an Australian case study and outline some
of the strengths and weaknesses of the technique. We conclude that MSC can
make an important contribution to evaluation practice. Its unusual
methodology and outcomes make it ideal for use in combination with other

These relations can be expressed in arbitrarily complex ways. The architecture uses word level embeddings and other linguistic features to detect causal events and their effects mentioned within a sentence. The extracted events and their relations are used to build a causal-graph after clustering and appropriate generalization, which is then used for predictive purposes. We have evaluated the performance of the proposed extraction model with respect to two baseline systems,one a rule-based classifier, and the other a conditional random field (CRF) based supervised model. We have also compared our results with related work reported in the past by other authors on SEMEVAL data set, and found that the proposed bi-directional LSTM model enhanced with an additional linguistic layer performs better. We have also worked extensively on creating new annotated datasets from publicly available data, which we are willing to share with the community.},

  author = {Davies, Richard J},
  year = {1998},
  abstract = {The aim of this thesis is to develop a coherent theory of organisational learning which can generate practical means of assisting organisational learning. The thesis develops and applies this theory to one class of organisations known as non-government organisations (NGOs), and more specifically to those NGOs who receive funds from high income countries but who work for the benefit of the poor in low income countries. Of central concern are the processes whereby these NGOs learn from the rural and urban poor with whom they work. The basis of the theory of organisational learning used in this thesis is modern evolutionary theory, and more particularly, evolutionary epistemology. It is argued that this theory provides a means of both representing and assisting organisational learning. Firstly, it provides a simple definition of learning that can be operationalised at multiple scales of analysis: that of individuals, organisations, and populations of organisations. Differences in the forms of organisational learning that do take place can be represented using a number of observable attributes of learning which are derived from an interpretation of evolutionary theory. The same evolutionary theory can also provide useful explanations of processes thus defined and represented. Secondly, an analysis of organisational learning using these observable attributes and background theory also suggest two ways in which organisational learning can be assisted. One is the use of specific methods within NGOs: a type of participatory monitoring. The second is the use of particular interventions by their donors: demands for particular types of information which are indicative of how and where the NGO is learning},

This involves the re-iteration of variation, selection, and reproduction i.e., an embodiment of the evolutionary algorithm (Campbell, 1960; Dennett, 1996). The process is designed to be used by multiple people, to produce a collective good \textendash{} a set of storylines. In addition, the process generates data on the structure of participation \textendash{} how people have collaborated to produce those storylines.For users, ParEvo.org can be used to achieve two related kinds of purposes. The first is cognitive: to enable participants to creatively think about alternative futures, and how they do that thinking (meta-cognition). The second is more behavioural: to prompt consideration of ways of responding to possible futures, in anticipation and/or in response, and to exploit and/or mitigate the consequences.This paper illustrates how a ParEvo exercise is implemented and analysed, along with an explanation of its origins and subsequent use. Illustrative references are made to two recent exercises carried out by the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk (CSER), in Cambridge, UK. Three types of evaluation challenges are highlighted, concerning the performance  of individual participants, specific exercises and the platform as a whole. Researchers in collective intelligence are invited to explore the uses of the application, and to address some of the challenges raised in this paper},

Interest has similarly grown in efforts to increase transparency, such as preregistration of hypotheses and methods, that seek to allay concerns that improved research designs do not address per se, such as publication bias and p-hacking. Yet, although these efforts improve the informativeness and interpretation of research results, relatively little attention has been paid to another practice that could help to achieve this goal: relating research findings to the views of the scientific community, policy-makers, and the general public. We suggest below three broad ways in which systematic collection of predictions of research results will prove useful: by improving the interpretation of research results, mitigating bias against null results, and improving predictive accuracy and experimental design.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Medical Research Councils' framework for complex interventions has been criticized for not including theory-driven approaches to evaluation. Although the framework does include broad guidance on the use of theory, it contains little practical guidance for implementers and there have been calls to develop a more comprehensive approach. A prospective, theory-driven process of intervention design and evaluation is required to develop complex healthcare interventions which are more likely to be effective, sustainable and scalable. METHODS: We propose a theory-driven approach to the design and evaluation of complex interventions by adapting and integrating a programmatic design and evaluation tool, Theory of Change (ToC), into the MRC framework for complex interventions. We provide a guide to what ToC is, how to construct one, and how to integrate its use into research projects seeking to design, implement and evaluate complex interventions using the MRC framework. We test this approach by using ToC within two randomized controlled trials and one non-randomized evaluation of complex interventions. RESULTS: Our application of ToC in three research projects has shown that ToC can strengthen key stages of the MRC framework. It can aid the development of interventions by providing a framework for enhanced stakeholder engagement and by explicitly designing an intervention that is embedded in the local context. For the feasibility and piloting stage, ToC enables the systematic identification of knowledge gaps to generate research questions that strengthen intervention design. ToC may improve the evaluation of interventions by providing a comprehensive set of indicators to evaluate all stages of the causal pathway through which an intervention achieves impact, combining evaluations of intervention effectiveness with detailed process evaluations into one theoretical framework. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating a ToC approach into the MRC framework holds promise for improving the design and evaluation of complex interventions, thereby increasing the likelihood that the intervention will be ultimately effective, sustainable and scalable. We urge researchers developing and evaluating complex interventions to consider using this approach, to evaluate its usefulness and to build an evidence base to further refine the methodology.

Psychosocial community programs are based on outreach activities by local practitioners trained and supported by the American Red Cross.

Rarely, however, do task designers start by considering what systems should in fact comprehend. In this paper we make two key contributions. First, we argue that existing approaches do not adequately define comprehension; they are too unsystematic about what content is tested. Second, we present a detailed definition of comprehension---a ``Template of Understanding''---for a widely useful class of texts, namely short narratives. We then conduct an experiment that strongly suggests existing systems are not up to the task of narrative understanding as we define it.},

\par
"As noted above, cause maps are directed graphs. They are therefore characterized by an hierarchical structure which is most often in the form of a means/ ends graph. However the hierarchical form of a map is often destroyed by circularity in which a chain of means and ends loops back on itselc indeed circularity is often regarded as the fundamental structural characteristic of a map" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNLP64PY?page=2}{Eden et al 1992:310})
\par
"For representational purposes a cause map is usually drawn as short pieces of text linked with unidirectional arrows. In the general case, a statement at the tail of an arrow is taken to cause the statement at the arrow head. For cognitive maps the causality is less precise and relates, by implication, the first phrase of a bi-polar construct to the first phrase of the second construct. When an arrow head has a -ve sign attached then the first pole of the tail construct implies the second pole of the head construct. Typically a node (or construct) which has no implication (out-arrows) is referred to as a 'head', and a node which has no in-arrows is referred to as a 'tail'. Figure 1 shows a typical cognitive map." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/QNLP64PY?page=2}{Eden et al 1992:310})

"If a map is to be any sort of reflection of an individual's cognition (but see Eden, 1992 in this volume) then it must be distinctively different from the map of any other individual's cognition.

They note that the interpretation of a cause map depends on the theoretical rules for the map, which are often not made explicit. Mention Eden's earlier work on open interviewing techniques, based on Kelly. Cause maps are directed graphs. This approach is unusual in assuming that a cause map is a hierarchy; they are usually constructed as means-ends graphs, which could be expected to be hierarchical; loops are also mentioned. Factors and links have + or \textendash{} values. Cause maps can assist in helping to see or understand larger numbers of relationships. Layout algorithms can be used to assist in this. Discuss some basic network metrics like ratio of links to nodes, and number of neighbours of individual nodes, and ways to identify important nodes; the presence and importance of clusters. Discuss similarities and differences between individual and group maps. Discuss how to simplify a map either during data collection or during analysis.

This may be because the public knows little about aid and its effects. Evidence for the effects of aid projects may therefore be of particular importance in shaping attitudes. In a survey experiment carried out among the German population (N {$\approx$} 6000), we presented a claim on the effectiveness of an aid project or the same claim plus experimental evidence, qualitative evidence or anecdotal evidence and compared it to a no information control group. Results revealed that the claim increases both belief in the effectiveness of aid as well as support for aid. Among all forms of evidence tested, anecdotal evidence performs best, followed by experimental evidence. Pre-manipulation support for aid partly moderates the effect of the claim, but those who support aid do not react more strongly to the two forms of scientific evidence (experimental/qualitative).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The success of a government's COVID-19 control strategy relies on public trust and broad acceptance of response measures. We investigated public perceptions of the UK government's COVID-19 response, focusing on the relationship between trust and perceived transparency, during the first wave (April 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. METHODS: Anonymous survey data were collected (2020-04-06 to 2020-04-22) from 9,322 respondents, aged 20+ using an online questionnaire shared primarily through Facebook. We took an embedded-mixed-methods approach to data analysis. Missing data were imputed via multiple imputation. Binomial \& multinomial logistic regression were used to detect associations between demographic characteristics and perceptions or opinions of the UK government's response to COVID-19. Structural topic modelling (STM), qualitative thematic coding of sub-sets of responses were then used to perform a thematic analysis of topics that were of interest to key demographic groups. RESULTS: Most respondents (95.1\%) supported government enforcement of behaviour change. While 52.1\% of respondents thought the government was making good decisions, differences were apparent across demographic groups, for example respondents from Scotland had lower odds of responding positively than respondents in London. Higher educational levels saw decreasing odds of having a positive opinion of the government response and decreasing household income associated with decreasing positive opinion. Of respondents who thought the government was not making good decisions 60\% believed the economy was being prioritised over people and their health. Positive views on government decision-making were associated with positive views on government transparency about the COVID-19 response. Qualitative analysis about perceptions of government transparency highlighted five key themes: (1) the justification of opacity due to the condition of crisis, (2) generalised mistrust of politics, (3) concerns about the role of scientific evidence, (4) quality of government communication and (5) questions about political decision-making processes. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that trust is not homogenous across communities, and that generalised mistrust, concerns about the transparent use and communication of evidence and insights into decision-making processes can affect perceptions of the government's pandemic response. We recommend targeted community engagement, tailored to the experiences of different groups and a new focus on accountability and openness around how decisions are made in the response to the UK COVID-19 pandemic.},

These approaches to causal investigation differ with regard to their modi operandi, the types of patterns they look for, their underlying assumptions and the challenges they face. Morphological inquiries elaborate causal arguments by uncovering patterns in the empirical layout of socio-historical phenomena. To this end, these inquiries draw on descriptive techniques of data formalization. Variable-centered studies engage causal issues by investigating patterns of association among empirical categories under the twofold assumption that these categories a priori have explanatory relevance and each category empirically has the same meaning across cases. Genetic analyses ground their causal claims by identifying patterned processes of emergence or production.}

This paper presents three findings on VARs' ability to describe monetary policy. First, the correlation between forecast errors is a misleading measure of how closely the VAR forecast mimics the futures market's. In particular, the low correlation is partly due to a weak positive correlation between the VAR forecasts and the futures market errors. Second, Fed funds rate forecasts from common VAR specifications do tend to be noisy, but this can be remedied by estimating more parsimonious models on post-1982 data. Third, time aggregation problems caused by the structure of the Fed funds futures market can distort the timing and magnitude of shocks derived from futures rates, and complicate comparisons with VAR-based forecasts.},

We draw on the school of Bayesian ``probability as extended logic,'' where probabilities represent rational degrees of belief in propositions given limited information, to provide a solid foundation for iterative research that has been lacking in the qualitative methods literature. We argue that mechanisms for distinguishing exploratory from confirmatory stages of analysis that have been suggested in the context of APSA's DA-RT transparency initiative are unnecessary for qualitative research that is guided by logical Bayesianism, because new evidence has no special status relative to old evidence for testing hypotheses within this inferential framework. Bayesian probability not only fits naturally with how we intuitively move back and forth between theory and data, but also provides a framework for rational reasoning that mitigates confirmation bias and ad-hoc hypothesizing\textemdash two common problems associated with iterative research. Moreover, logical Bayesianism facilitates scrutiny of findings by the academic community for signs of sloppy or motivated reasoning. We illustrate these points with an application to recent research on state building.},

  abstract = {Food waste is an important sustainability issue that needs to be addressed. Consumer behaviour is one of the biggest sources of food waste in developed countries. To successfully reduce consumer-related food waste, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of its major root causes at the level of the individual. The present manuscript presents the results of an exploratory on-line survey that was made available through Google Drive and conducted among a representative sample of 1058 Italian individuals. The information contained in the questionnaire related to the characteristics of the individual respondents, their attitudes to expenditure and food, and their opinions of measures to reduce or prevent food waste. Data analysis was conducted in three phases. The first phase allowed for the identification, with the application of descriptive statistics, of the socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents and why, what, and how much they wasted. In the second phase, linear regression analysis and causal maps were used to both measure the statistical dependence between variables and to identify the main root causes of food waste in the phase of individual consumption. As expected, the perceived quantity of food waste that was declared by respondents was very low. Among the major root causes identified, the socio-demographic characteristics of consumers, types of food shopping purchases, and consumer behaviour played a key role. A causal map was drawn, which offers an immediate vision of the major root causes and can be a useful tool for policymakers who intend to introduce measures to combat food waste. Finally, participants' responses showed that the main initiatives needed to eliminate waste are the separate collection and dissemination of more information on the impact that waste has on the environment. For these reasons, information and education policies are crucial for changing consumer lifestyles and raising awareness of the value of food.},

  note = {Extracted Annotations (30/06/2015 15:33:09) "Economics of Resilience Study - Kenya Country Report" (Fitzgibbon 2012:1) "42\% of income in Kenya is controlled by less than 10\% of the population" (Fitzgibbon 2012:1) "However over 80\% of Kenya's land mass is defined as arid and semiarid lands (ASALs). These are home to nearly one third of the population and 70\% of the livestock herd." (Fitzgibbon 2012:1) "In the vast northern districts of Turkana, Marsabit, Wajir and Mandera between 74\% - 97\% of people live below the absolute poverty line" (Fitzgibbon 2012:1) very detailed and thorough (note on p.1) "Coordination of Drought Emergencies in Kenya Kenya has a draft Disaster Management Policy however no official policy or legal framework exists.to guide disaster management." (Fitzgibbon 2012:3) "The Government and relevant stakeholders, including the Kenyan population in general and disasteraffected populations in particular, have in the past managed disasters reasonably well, courtesy of the multi-sectoral and multi-agency approach." (Fitzgibbon 2012:3) "The UN cluster system has been activated from time to time, primarily after the post-election violence in 2008. Clusters vary considerably in their levels of activity and effectiveness." (Fitzgibbon 2012:3) "Clusters are often primarily focused on the humanitarian needs of the 500,000 refugees in Kenya, mostly located in the camps at Dadaab and Kakuma." (Fitzgibbon 2012:3) "Some argue that examination of long term rainfall patterns and NDVI 4 data for Kenya show the frequency of drought and erratic rainfall has not change" (Fitzgibbon 2012:3) "It seems clear that even if the intensity of droughts is not increasing currently, the economic, social and other impacts on Kenya are increasing." (Fitzgibbon 2012:3) "Pastoralist and agropastoralists are also characterised by being wholly or semi-nomadic. This means they differ from mixed or sedentary farmers in that "most of the food their livestock eats is natural forage rather than cultivated fodders or pastures". It is now more widely acknowledged that pastoralists are astute land managers whose mobility enables them to make the most productive use of drought-prone rangelands." (Fitzgibbon 2012:4) "Despite this, pastoralism is only beginning to be accepted as a valuable economic production system. For many decades governments perceived pastoralists as "backward", economically inefficient and environmentally destructive." (Fitzgibbon 2012:5) " Land fragmentation: pastoral mobility is increasingly restrained as land is converted for agriculture or ranching, is invaded by non-local plants, is enclosed for individual use, or removed to become a protected area 9 . Poor land use planning means dry season grazing areas and water points are no longer accessible to pastoral herders" (Fitzgibbon 2012:5) " Population increase: Populations in the ASAL areas of Kenya have increased dramatically in the last two decades. For example the population of North Eastern Province increase six fold between 1989 and 2009 from 371,000 to 2.3 million. Clearly it will be difficult for this delicate eco-system to support such numbers by pastoralism alone." (Fitzgibbon 2012:5) " Low literacy and education provision: Rates of retention, survival and completion in Northern Kenya are way below the rest of the country." (Fitzgibbon 2012:6) " Poor infrastructure: ASAL areas have the lowest proportion of tarmac or quality roads in the Kenya, only one town (Isiolo) is connected to the national grid" (Fitzgibbon 2012:6) " Weak market integration: Poor infrastructure leads to inflated prices for food and other basic commodities as a result of high transportation costs" (Fitzgibbon 2012:6) "What is the cost of humanitarian response? There is a direct financial cost associated with responding to each drought episode." (Fitzgibbon 2012:7) "Over the last decade the amount of international humanitarian aid to Kenya has been tracked annually by UNOCHA 13" (Fitzgibbon 2012:7) "The Wider Costs of Drought Emergencies on Kenya The regular and periodic droughts (and floods) experienced in Kenya clearly have major socioeconomic impacts and reduce economic growth" (Fitzgibbon 2012:8) "The first attempt to systematically quantify the economic impact of drought was done earlier this year when the Government of Kenya completed a Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) 16 for the extended 2008-2011 drought period." (Fitzgibbon 2012:8) "3.2 National Level - What is the cost of early response? Costing early response from a national perspective is not easy as any response clearly incorporates a range of interventions some of which occur earlier than others. Generally national drought responses have rarely been described as timely and criticisms of late response abound 19 ." (Fitzgibbon 2012:10) "Arid Lands Resource Management Project (ALRMP) At the national level on-going government support for drought response in Kenya has been the remit of the Arid Lands Resource Management Project (ALRMP). This Government led programme established in 1996 with on-going funding from the World Bank (and other donors)." (Fitzgibbon 2012:10) "Unfortunately donor funding to the ASALs was significantly reduced when the ALRMP closed down at the end of 2010. In the last year the Government has launched a new National Drought Management Authority (N" (Fitzgibbon 2012:11) "Despite this drought response in Kenya cannot be described as timely and is still heavily reliant on the short and long rains assessment reports." (Fitzgibbon 2012:11) "3.3 National Level - What is the cost of resilience? Given the wide range of interventions that could be described as resilience, this cost is difficult to assess at the national level. However recently, a couple of national estimates have been developed. These include the following:" (Fitzgibbon 2012:11) " Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) 21 - in addition to quantifying the damages and losses resulting from the drought the PDNA calculated the disaster risk reduction (DRR) needs of each sector assessed." (Fitzgibbon 2012:11) "Table 6: Estimated 5 years Costs of Implementing Mid-Term Implementation Plan of Ministry of Northern Kenya (US\$ million)" (Fitzgibbon 2012:13) "Kenya has a plethora of national, sectoral and ministerial development plans. The primary national plan is Kenya Vision 2030 which forms the long-term development blue print for the country." (Fitzgibbon 2012:13) "Only North Eastern Province is wholly arid. The stark differences in social indicators for this province are clear but it is also the least populated province. When national budgets are being developed there is a strong tendency to allocate funds to districts on the basis of population. Although there has been some effort to prioritise CDF and LATF 23 budgets to the poorest areas (which includes arid districts) these additional funds are actually very small when compared with Government's annual revenue spending in a less vulnerable location." (Fitzgibbon 2012:13) "National Expenditure on Resilience by International Donors Despite the high profile of drought emergencies in Kenya, even international donor funding is also inherently skewed towards non-ASAL areas. For example USAID is by far the largest humanitarian donor to Kenya providing over US\$231m to the drought crisis in 2011 (the majority of this was for food aid). It can be assumed the majority of this was directed to the ASAL areas (which also includes refugees in Kenyan camps). Although this represented 33\% of the total international response it still represents less than 20\% of total US funding to Kenya that focuses almost exclusively on the high potential areas." (Fitzgibbon 2012:14) "3.4 District and Project Level Cost Comparisons At a sub-national level it is easier to assess the relative costs of the three response categories, identified by the study, from a sectoral perspective." (Fitzgibbon 2012:14) "If the costs per beneficiary are doubled to crudely reflect a 12 month period they are actually almost exactly the same at \$54.83 as the current WFP food relief cost per person. The added benefit being the timeliness of the transfer prevents asset erosion and the size of payment is modified to reflect the differing need of various local livelihoods and wealth groups." (Fitzgibbon 2012:16) "such programmes would be less expensive per beneficiary (US\$45) than the current estimated cost of food aid and the figure assessed using HEA modelling. However the coverage levels proposed are much higher (\{\$\textbackslash backslash\$textgreater\}80\% of the population) than those normally allocated food aid (approximately 15-30\%) resulting in a greater absolute cost." (Fitzgibbon 2012:16) "The initial registration of the proposed HSNP households in northern Kenya will begin shortly. Each household will be issued with an electronic 'smart card / e-voucher'. It would clearly be practical and efficient if WFP's PRRO food assistance pipeline could be distributed using the same card (and also using private distribution agents and traders in the mode of the HSNP)." (Fitzgibbon 2012:16) "Seasonal HEA Outcome Analysis for Northern Kenya: July 2011: Save the Children UK" (Fitzgibbon 2012:16) "Using Food and Cash Transfers to Build Resilience - The extent to which food and cash transfers alone ever truly build resilience, is a topic of heated debate. It can be argued that transfers to individual households can build their resilience if given at the right level i.e. the livelihood threshold which prevents households from eating into assets at times of stress." (Fitzgibbon 2012:18) "Conversely it can be argued that protecting assets does not build resilience but merely maintains the status quo and the household will need the same level of assistance in the next crisis." (Fitzgibbon 2012:18) "This would mean the household is more resilient in the face of the current crisis because of the transfer but not necessarily resilient to future, repeated crisis without the transfer. Ultimately the test of a good resilience building activity is one which reduces the caseload of beneficiaries in need of food or cash subsidies via any modality." (Fitzgibbon 2012:18) "Food for work programmes have been expanding in Kenya recently, particularly through the WFP Food for Assets programme (FFA) whereby communities are provided with food in exchange for their participation in works that strengthen their self-sufficiency and create assets that improve their food security." (Fitzgibbon 2012:18) "This has proven to stimulate markets with traders increasing incomes, turnover and trade in remote market locations. In addition, imported pulses in the food ration were substituted for vouchers for local food products (namely milk, meat and fish) purchased from local producers. This worked to provide a guaranteed local market for producers, many of whom were food aid beneficiaries throughout the drought period 34 ." (Fitzgibbon 2012:18) "Water emerges as the priority need for almost all drought affected communities. Although it does not represent the most significant humanitarian response cost, WASH interventions are the most frequent, widespread and regular." (Fitzgibbon 2012:18) "In total Government of Kenya provided nearly Ksh 1.2 billion (US\$14 million) in emergency water assistance which is twice that provided by the international community (US\$7.2m)." (Fitzgibbon 2012:19) "crude annual average cost of US\$1.87 per head. Clearly this cost only includes that recorded as emergency response and is divided by the entire population of the drought affected districts although only a small proportion benefited." (Fitzgibbon 2012:19) "When asked about the most useful and effective emergency response, beneficiaries regularly cite water tankering." (Fitzgibbon 2012:19) "WESCOORD members have agreed that emergency water tankering (i.e. paid for by GoK or agency humanitarian funds) should only be undertaken when human life is at risk. This is not always the case and many of the water tankering projects assessed in the 2009 assessment provided water for livestock. Very often livestock owners buy water for their herds raising the necessary resources from the sale of animals (see livestock section below). Livestock mortality is very often a factor of lack of water for herds." (Fitzgibbon 2012:19) "Quantifying the millions spent privately by families and pastoral producers on private water tankering to ensure their own and their herds survival is difficult." (Fitzgibbon 2012:20) "Given water is a perennial issue in ASAL areas, it regularly emerges as the primary concern when communities are facilitated to undertake risk and vulnerability assessments 37 . Consequently many NGOs have supported communities to develop appropriate, sustainable water sources, and build their capacity to manage and maintain them even through severe drought episodes." (Fitzgibbon 2012:20) "It is important to note that not all communities require emergency water tankering during drought periods. The majority of locations in the ASALs cope. These communities will usually have strategic water reserves in place e.g. dry season boreholes or reserve tanks." (Fitzgibbon 2012:20) "What all agencies supporting community water schemes stress is that establishing an effective WUA takes time and requires on-going support. It is considered impossible to establish a sustainable water user association within the timeframe of a humanitarian grant (12- 18 months maximum)." (Fitzgibbon 2012:20) xi really interesting - water resources would be really wanted and required by a minority of communities but overlaps in complex ways with private purchase of water eg for livestock. it is a long-term intervention cos you need to get community groups goingWhat all agencies supporting community water schemes stress is that establishing an effective WUA takes time and requires on-going support. It is considered impossible to establish a sustainable water user association within the timeframe of a humanitarian grant (12-18 months maximum). (note on p.20) "In discussions with NGOs 39 engaged in long term community water programmes it was considered reasonable to cost such projects over 10 years to ensure 'resilience'. Since water forms the foundation of all other community based DRR programming, this expenditure should also facilitate and support communities to undertake a range of complementary (and often low cost) activities." (Fitzgibbon 2012:21) "The Wider Costs and Benefits of Community Managed WASH programmes So are community managed water schemes a more cost effective approach? Some may argue that well managed and sustainable community water schemes function on a cost recovery basis and therefore should be generating sufficient income to cover operational costs long before 10 years." (Fitzgibbon 2012:21) "Anecdotally there is wide support for community managed and supported risk reduction programmes. Unfortunately there is limited cost data to undertake a more rigorous cost analysis." (Fitzgibbon 2012:22) " Animal Health - precisely the same interventions are proposed however vaccination campaigns undertaken before the drought has affected animals' body condition is far more effective than vaccination during a drought." (Fitzgibbon 2012:23) "Assessing the Wider Costs and Benefits - Livestock Reducing livestock mortality is essential given the sector represents such a high proportion of all damage and losses incurred 50 during drought periods. The livestock mortality experienced in recent droughts has resulted in increasing numbers of pastoral 'drop-outs' i.e. households that can no longer make ends meet from raising livestock alone. These households form the most chronically food insecure group increasingly reliant on food aid and cash safety nets for survival year round." (Fitzgibbon 2012:28) "The loss of milk from the pastoral diet during dry periods is thought to be one of the biggest factors affecting the chronically high child malnutrition rates in pastoral areas 5" (Fitzgibbon 2012:28) also a lot of stuff on livestock (note on p.28) "3.5.4 Other Interventions There is an endless array of interventions that can be undertaken in responding to humanitarian crisis and / or to build resilience. An indicative list is given below:  Expanding / Diversification of Livelihood activities" (Fitzgibbon 2012:29) " Expand basic and social services o Expanded coverage and completion of education" (Fitzgibbon 2012:30) " Expansion of wider scale infrastructure o Roads" (Fitzgibbon 2012:30) "Table 15: Example Costs and Benefits of Livelihood Diversification Schemes in ASALs of Kenya" (Fitzgibbon 2012:32) "Tana River Irrigation scheme (ICRC)" (Fitzgibbon 2012:32) " Scaling up Most projects work at the community level and few have more than 5,000 beneficiaries and many far fewer." (Fitzgibbon 2012:33) " Long term income levels The incomes reported from diversification projects vary widely. In fact it was extremely difficult to identify projects for this study that could readily supply any beneficiary income data. Several agencies admitted they had never done any income monitoring so just do not know." (Fitzgibbon 2012:33) " Support for sustainability There is broad agreement that the successful establishment of community based enterprises in very poor or marginal areas requires a certain level of support." (Fitzgibbon 2012:33) "If an ASAL-wide database of livelihood projects were created many of these issues could be monitored on a long term basis." (Fitzgibbon 2012:33) "There is much evidence to show that education, especially of girls, is a key factor in improving family and child health and nutrition indicators. In addition to its many intrinsic benefits, education is one of the most important livelihood diversification strategies." (Fitzgibbon 2012:34) "This gap in provision represents an inherent and natural bias in the provision of public investment in the most underserved areas. Education provision in semi-arid areas is much closer to the national average whereas the arid districts lag way behind."

pastoralists are astute land managers whose mobility enables them to make
the most productive use of drought-prone rangelands." (Fitzgibbon 2012:4)

Drought Emergencies on Kenya The regular and periodic droughts (and

reduce economic growth" (Fitzgibbon 2012:8) "The first attempt to

the ALRMP closed down at the end of 2010. In the last year the Government
has launched a new National Drought Management Authority (N" (Fitzgibbon
2012:11) "Despite this drought response in Kenya cannot be described as
timely and is still heavily reliant on the short and long rains assessment
reports." (Fitzgibbon 2012:11) "3.3 National Level - What is the cost of
resilience? Given the wide range of interventions that could be described
as resilience, this cost is difficult to assess at the national level.
However recently, a couple of national estimates have been developed.
These include the following:" (Fitzgibbon 2012:11) " Post-Disaster Needs
Assessment (PDNA) 21 - in addition to quantifying the damages and losses
resulting from the drought the PDNA calculated the disaster risk reduction
(DRR) needs of each sector assessed." (Fitzgibbon 2012:11) "Table 6:
Estimated 5 years Costs of Implementing Mid-Term Implementation Plan of
Ministry of Northern Kenya (US\$ million)" (Fitzgibbon 2012:13) "Kenya has
a plethora of national, sectoral and ministerial development plans. The
primary national plan is Kenya Vision 2030 which forms the long-term
development blue print for the country." (Fitzgibbon 2012:13) "Only North
Eastern Province is wholly arid. The stark differences in social
indicators for this province are clear but it is also the least populated
province. When national budgets are being developed there is a strong
tendency to allocate funds to districts on the basis of population.
Although there has been some effort to prioritise CDF and LATF 23 budgets
to the poorest areas (which includes arid districts) these additional
funds are actually very small when compared with Government's annual
revenue spending in a less vulnerable location." (Fitzgibbon 2012:13)
"National Expenditure on Resilience by International Donors Despite the
high profile of drought emergencies in Kenya, even international donor
funding is also inherently skewed towards non-ASAL areas. For example
USAID is by far the largest humanitarian donor to Kenya providing over
US\$231m to the drought crisis in 2011 (the majority of this was for food
aid). It can be assumed the majority of this was directed to the ASAL
areas (which also includes refugees in Kenyan camps). Although this
represented 33\% of the total international response it still represents
less than 20\% of total US funding to Kenya that focuses almost exclusively
on the high potential areas." (Fitzgibbon 2012:14) "3.4 District and
Project Level Cost Comparisons At a sub-national level it is easier to
assess the relative costs of the three response categories, identified by
the study, from a sectoral perspective." (Fitzgibbon 2012:14) "If the
costs per beneficiary are doubled to crudely reflect a 12 month period
they are actually almost exactly the same at \$54.83 as the current WFP
food relief cost per person. The added benefit being the timeliness of the
transfer prevents asset erosion and the size of payment is modified to
reflect the differing need of various local livelihoods and wealth
groups." (Fitzgibbon 2012:16) "such programmes would be less expensive per
beneficiary (US\$45) than the current estimated cost of food aid and the
figure assessed using HEA modelling. However the coverage levels proposed
are much higher (\{\$\textbackslash backslash\$textgreater\}80\% of the population) than
those normally allocated food aid (approximately 15-30\%) resulting in a
greater absolute cost." (Fitzgibbon 2012:16) "The initial registration of
the proposed HSNP households in northern Kenya will begin shortly. Each
household will be issued with an electronic 'smart card / e-voucher'. It
would clearly be practical and efficient if WFP's PRRO food assistance
pipeline could be distributed using the same card (and also using private
distribution agents and traders in the mode of the HSNP)." (Fitzgibbon
2012:16) "Seasonal HEA Outcome Analysis for Northern Kenya: July 2011:
Save the Children UK" (Fitzgibbon 2012:16) "Using Food and Cash Transfers
to Build Resilience - The extent to which food and cash transfers alone
ever truly build resilience, is a topic of heated debate. It can be argued
that transfers to individual households can build their resilience if
given at the right level i.e. the livelihood threshold which prevents
households from eating into assets at times of stress." (Fitzgibbon
2012:18) "Conversely it can be argued that protecting assets does not
build resilience but merely maintains the status quo and the household
will need the same level of assistance in the next crisis." (Fitzgibbon
2012:18) "This would mean the household is more resilient in the face of
the current crisis because of the transfer but not necessarily resilient
to future, repeated crisis without the transfer. Ultimately the test of a
good resilience building activity is one which reduces the caseload of
beneficiaries in need of food or cash subsidies via any modality."
(Fitzgibbon 2012:18) "Food for work programmes have been expanding in
Kenya recently, particularly through the WFP Food for Assets programme
(FFA) whereby communities are provided with food in exchange for their
participation in works that strengthen their self-sufficiency and create
assets that improve their food security." (Fitzgibbon 2012:18) "This has
proven to stimulate markets with traders increasing incomes, turnover and
trade in remote market locations. In addition, imported pulses in the food
ration were substituted for vouchers for local food products (namely milk,
meat and fish) purchased from local producers. This worked to provide a
guaranteed local market for producers, many of whom were food aid
beneficiaries throughout the drought period 34 ." (Fitzgibbon 2012:18)
"Water emerges as the priority need for almost all drought affected
communities. Although it does not represent the most significant
humanitarian response cost, WASH interventions are the most frequent,
widespread and regular." (Fitzgibbon 2012:18) "In total Government of
Kenya provided nearly Ksh 1.2 billion (US\$14 million) in emergency water
assistance which is twice that provided by the international community
(US\$7.2m)." (Fitzgibbon 2012:19) "crude annual average cost of US\$1.87 per
head. Clearly this cost only includes that recorded as emergency response
and is divided by the entire population of the drought affected districts
although only a small proportion benefited." (Fitzgibbon 2012:19) "When
asked about the most useful and effective emergency response,
beneficiaries regularly cite water tankering." (Fitzgibbon 2012:19)
"WESCOORD members have agreed that emergency water tankering (i.e. paid
for by GoK or agency humanitarian funds) should only be undertaken when
human life is at risk. This is not always the case and many of the water
tankering projects assessed in the 2009 assessment provided water for
livestock. Very often livestock owners buy water for their herds raising
the necessary resources from the sale of animals (see livestock section
below). Livestock mortality is very often a factor of lack of water for
herds." (Fitzgibbon 2012:19) "Quantifying the millions spent privately by
families and pastoral producers on private water tankering to ensure their
own and their herds survival is difficult." (Fitzgibbon 2012:20) "Given
water is a perennial issue in ASAL areas, it regularly emerges as the
primary concern when communities are facilitated to undertake risk and
vulnerability assessments 37 . Consequently many NGOs have supported
communities to develop appropriate, sustainable water sources, and build
their capacity to manage and maintain them even through severe drought
episodes." (Fitzgibbon 2012:20) "It is important to note that not all
communities require emergency water tankering during drought periods. The
majority of locations in the ASALs cope. These communities will usually
have strategic water reserves in place e.g. dry season boreholes or
reserve tanks." (Fitzgibbon 2012:20) "What all agencies supporting
community water schemes stress is that establishing an effective WUA takes
time and requires on-going support. It is considered impossible to
establish a sustainable water user association within the timeframe of a
humanitarian grant (12- 18 months maximum)." (Fitzgibbon 2012:20) xi
really interesting - water resources would be really wanted and required
by a minority of communities but overlaps in complex ways with private
purchase of water eg for livestock. it is a long-term intervention cos you
need to get community groups goingWhat all agencies supporting community
water schemes stress is that establishing an effective WUA takes time and
requires on-going support. It is considered impossible to establish a
sustainable water user association within the timeframe of a humanitarian
grant (12-18 months maximum). (note on p.20) "In discussions with NGOs 39
engaged in long term community water programmes it was considered
reasonable to cost such projects over 10 years to ensure 'resilience'.
Since water forms the foundation of all other community based DRR
programming, this expenditure should also facilitate and support
communities to undertake a range of complementary (and often low cost)
activities." (Fitzgibbon 2012:21) "The Wider Costs and Benefits of
Community Managed WASH programmes So are community managed water schemes a
more cost effective approach? Some may argue that well managed and
sustainable community water schemes function on a cost recovery basis and
therefore should be generating sufficient income to cover operational
costs long before 10 years." (Fitzgibbon 2012:21) "Anecdotally there is
wide support for community managed and supported risk reduction
programmes. Unfortunately there is limited cost data to undertake a more
rigorous cost analysis." (Fitzgibbon 2012:22) " Animal Health - precisely
the same interventions are proposed however vaccination campaigns
undertaken before the drought has affected animals' body condition is far
more effective than vaccination during a drought." (Fitzgibbon 2012:23)
"Assessing the Wider Costs and Benefits - Livestock Reducing livestock
mortality is essential given the sector represents such a high proportion
of all damage and losses incurred 50 during drought periods. The livestock
mortality experienced in recent droughts has resulted in increasing
numbers of pastoral 'drop-outs' i.e. households that can no longer make
ends meet from raising livestock alone. These households form the most
chronically food insecure group increasingly reliant on food aid and cash
safety nets for survival year round." (Fitzgibbon 2012:28) "The loss of
milk from the pastoral diet during dry periods is thought to be one of the
biggest factors affecting the chronically high child malnutrition rates in
pastoral areas 5" (Fitzgibbon 2012:28) also a lot of stuff on livestock
(note on p.28) "3.5.4 Other Interventions There is an endless array of
interventions that can be undertaken in responding to humanitarian crisis
and / or to build resilience. An indicative list is given below: 
Expanding / Diversification of Livelihood activities" (Fitzgibbon 2012:29)
" Expand basic and social services o Expanded coverage and completion of
education" (Fitzgibbon 2012:30) " Expansion of wider scale infrastructure
o Roads" (Fitzgibbon 2012:30) "Table 15: Example Costs and Benefits of
Livelihood Diversification Schemes in ASALs of Kenya" (Fitzgibbon 2012:32)
"Tana River Irrigation scheme (ICRC)" (Fitzgibbon 2012:32) " Scaling up
Most projects work at the community level and few have more than 5,000
beneficiaries and many far fewer." (Fitzgibbon 2012:33) " Long term
income levels The incomes reported from diversification projects vary
widely. In fact it was extremely difficult to identify projects for this
study that could readily supply any beneficiary income data. Several
agencies admitted they had never done any income monitoring so just do not
know." (Fitzgibbon 2012:33) " Support for sustainability There is broad
agreement that the successful establishment of community based enterprises
in very poor or marginal areas requires a certain level of support."
(Fitzgibbon 2012:33) "If an ASAL-wide database of livelihood projects were
created many of these issues could be monitored on a long term basis."
(Fitzgibbon 2012:33) "There is much evidence to show that education,
especially of girls, is a key factor in improving family and child health
and nutrition indicators. In addition to its many intrinsic benefits,
education is one of the most important livelihood diversification
strategies." (Fitzgibbon 2012:34) "This gap in provision represents an
inherent and natural bias in the provision of public investment in the
most underserved areas. Education provision in semi-arid areas is much
closer to the national average whereas the arid districts lag way behind."
(Fitzgibbon 2012:36) "COST COMPARISON SCENARIOS FOR A TYPICAL KENYAN ASAL
DISTRICT" (Fitzgibbon 2012:40) "The main report has attempted to quantify
these costs for pastoral households using HEA analysis and the herd
dynamic model developed by the Food Economy Group 66 ." (Fitzgibbon

household will be issued with an electronic 'smart card / e-voucher'. It
would clearly be practical and efficient if WFP's PRRO food assistance
pipeline could be distributed using the same card (and also using private
distribution agents and traders in the mode of the HSNP)." (Fitzgibbon
2012:16) "Seasonal HEA Outcome Analysis for Northern Kenya: July 2011:
Save the Children UK" (Fitzgibbon 2012:16) "Using Food and Cash Transfers
to Build Resilience - The extent to which food and cash transfers alone
ever truly build resilience, is a topic of heated debate. It can be argued
that transfers to individual households can build their resilience if
given at the right level i.e. the livelihood threshold which prevents
households from eating into assets at times of stress." (Fitzgibbon
2012:18) "Conversely it can be argued that protecting assets does not
build resilience but merely maintains the status quo and the household
will need the same level of assistance in the next crisis." (Fitzgibbon
2012:18) "This would mean the household is more resilient in the face of
the current crisis because of the transfer but not necessarily resilient
to future, repeated crisis without the transfer. Ultimately the test of a
good resilience building activity is one which reduces the caseload of
beneficiaries in need of food or cash subsidies via any modality."
(Fitzgibbon 2012:18) "Food for work programmes have been expanding in
Kenya recently, particularly through the WFP Food for Assets programme
(FFA) whereby communities are provided with food in exchange for their
participation in works that strengthen their self-sufficiency and create
assets that improve their food security." (Fitzgibbon 2012:18) "This has
proven to stimulate markets with traders increasing incomes, turnover and
trade in remote market locations. In addition, imported pulses in the food
ration were substituted for vouchers for local food products (namely milk,
meat and fish) purchased from local producers. This worked to provide a
guaranteed local market for producers, many of whom were food aid
beneficiaries throughout the drought period 34 ." (Fitzgibbon 2012:18)
"Water emerges as the priority need for almost all drought affected
communities. Although it does not represent the most significant
humanitarian response cost, WASH interventions are the most frequent,
widespread and regular." (Fitzgibbon 2012:18) "In total Government of
Kenya provided nearly Ksh 1.2 billion (US\$14 million) in emergency water
assistance which is twice that provided by the international community
(US\$7.2m)." (Fitzgibbon 2012:19) "crude annual average cost of US\$1.87 per
head. Clearly this cost only includes that recorded as emergency response
and is divided by the entire population of the drought affected districts
although only a small proportion benefited." (Fitzgibbon 2012:19) "When
asked about the most useful and effective emergency response,
beneficiaries regularly cite water tankering." (Fitzgibbon 2012:19)
"WESCOORD members have agreed that emergency water tankering (i.e. paid
for by GoK or agency humanitarian funds) should only be undertaken when
human life is at risk. This is not always the case and many of the water
tankering projects assessed in the 2009 assessment provided water for
livestock. Very often livestock owners buy water for their herds raising
the necessary resources from the sale of animals (see livestock section
below). Livestock mortality is very often a factor of lack of water for
herds." (Fitzgibbon 2012:19) "Quantifying the millions spent privately by
families and pastoral producers on private water tankering to ensure their
own and their herds survival is difficult." (Fitzgibbon 2012:20) "Given
water is a perennial issue in ASAL areas, it regularly emerges as the
primary concern when communities are facilitated to undertake risk and
vulnerability assessments 37 . Consequently many NGOs have supported
communities to develop appropriate, sustainable water sources, and build
their capacity to manage and maintain them even through severe drought
episodes." (Fitzgibbon 2012:20) "It is important to note that not all
communities require emergency water tankering during drought periods. The
majority of locations in the ASALs cope. These communities will usually
have strategic water reserves in place e.g. dry season boreholes or
reserve tanks." (Fitzgibbon 2012:20) "What all agencies supporting
community water schemes stress is that establishing an effective WUA takes
time and requires on-going support. It is considered impossible to
establish a sustainable water user association within the timeframe of a
humanitarian grant (12- 18 months maximum)." (Fitzgibbon 2012:20) xi
really interesting - water resources would be really wanted and required
by a minority of communities but overlaps in complex ways with private
purchase of water eg for livestock. it is a long-term intervention cos you
need to get community groups goingWhat all agencies supporting community
water schemes stress is that establishing an effective WUA takes time and
requires on-going support. It is considered impossible to establish a
sustainable water user association within the timeframe of a humanitarian
grant (12-18 months maximum). (note on p.20) "In discussions with NGOs 39
engaged in long term community water programmes it was considered
reasonable to cost such projects over 10 years to ensure 'resilience'.
Since water forms the foundation of all other community based DRR
programming, this expenditure should also facilitate and support
communities to undertake a range of complementary (and often low cost)
activities." (Fitzgibbon 2012:21) "The Wider Costs and Benefits of
Community Managed WASH programmes So are community managed water schemes a
more cost effective approach? Some may argue that well managed and
sustainable community water schemes function on a cost recovery basis and
therefore should be generating sufficient income to cover operational
costs long before 10 years." (Fitzgibbon 2012:21) "Anecdotally there is
wide support for community managed and supported risk reduction
programmes. Unfortunately there is limited cost data to undertake a more
rigorous cost analysis." (Fitzgibbon 2012:22) " Animal Health - precisely
the same interventions are proposed however vaccination campaigns
undertaken before the drought has affected animals' body condition is far
more effective than vaccination during a drought." (Fitzgibbon 2012:23)
"Assessing the Wider Costs and Benefits - Livestock Reducing livestock
mortality is essential given the sector represents such a high proportion
of all damage and losses incurred 50 during drought periods. The livestock
mortality experienced in recent droughts has resulted in increasing
numbers of pastoral 'drop-outs' i.e. households that can no longer make
ends meet from raising livestock alone. These households form the most
chronically food insecure group increasingly reliant on food aid and cash
safety nets for survival year round." (Fitzgibbon 2012:28) "The loss of
milk from the pastoral diet during dry periods is thought to be one of the
biggest factors affecting the chronically high child malnutrition rates in
pastoral areas 5" (Fitzgibbon 2012:28) also a lot of stuff on livestock
(note on p.28) "3.5.4 Other Interventions There is an endless array of
interventions that can be undertaken in responding to humanitarian crisis
and / or to build resilience. An indicative list is given below: 
Expanding / Diversification of Livelihood activities" (Fitzgibbon 2012:29)
" Expand basic and social services o Expanded coverage and completion of
education" (Fitzgibbon 2012:30) " Expansion of wider scale infrastructure
o Roads" (Fitzgibbon 2012:30) "Table 15: Example Costs and Benefits of
Livelihood Diversification Schemes in ASALs of Kenya" (Fitzgibbon 2012:32)
"Tana River Irrigation scheme (ICRC)" (Fitzgibbon 2012:32) " Scaling up
Most projects work at the community level and few have more than 5,000
beneficiaries and many far fewer." (Fitzgibbon 2012:33) " Long term
income levels The incomes reported from diversification projects vary
widely. In fact it was extremely difficult to identify projects for this
study that could readily supply any beneficiary income data. Several
agencies admitted they had never done any income monitoring so just do not
know." (Fitzgibbon 2012:33) " Support for sustainability There is broad
agreement that the successful establishment of community based enterprises
in very poor or marginal areas requires a certain level of support."
(Fitzgibbon 2012:33) "If an ASAL-wide database of livelihood projects were
created many of these issues could be monitored on a long term basis."
(Fitzgibbon 2012:33) "There is much evidence to show that education,
especially of girls, is a key factor in improving family and child health
and nutrition indicators. In addition to its many intrinsic benefits,
education is one of the most important livelihood diversification
strategies." (Fitzgibbon 2012:34) "This gap in provision represents an
inherent and natural bias in the provision of public investment in the
most underserved areas. Education provision in semi-arid areas is much
closer to the national average whereas the arid districts lag way behind."
(Fitzgibbon 2012:36) "COST COMPARISON SCENARIOS FOR A TYPICAL KENYAN ASAL
DISTRICT" (Fitzgibbon 2012:40) "The main report has attempted to quantify
these costs for pastoral households using HEA analysis and the herd
dynamic model developed by the Food Economy Group 66 ." (Fitzgibbon
2012:40) "For Kenya the HEA modelling was run for one pastoral livelihood
zone - Wajir Southern Grasslands in Northern Kenya. T" (Fitzgibbon
2012:40) "Scenario B1 - Early Response with commercial destocking of 50\%
of excess adult animal death Arid District with Rural pastoral population
of 367,000" (Fitzgibbon 2012:43) "Scenario C Early Response to droughts +
Ongoing Resilience Building" (Fitzgibbon 2012:44) "Conclusions  Early
response is more cost effective than late humanitarian response The
research confirms the intuitive hypothesis that responding on time and
before the full impact of drought is felt is cheaper and more effective.
The model and assumptions used in this report, which were based on actual
costs wherever possible yielded a cost per head approximately 50\% lower in
both drought and non-drought years." (Fitzgibbon 2012:51) " Building
resilience is initially expensive but saves money over time" (Fitzgibbon
2012:51) " Resilience is a broad term and not all resilience
interventions represent value for money" (Fitzgibbon 2012:51) " Drought
prone areas face a disproportionate lack of investment in resilience
building interventions compared to other parts of Kenya The vast majority
of humanitarian aid to Kenya is directed to the ASALs. Although annual
humanitarian aid is high and likely to remain so, it still forms the
minority of overall overseas development assistance." (Fitzgibbon 2012:52)
"Recommendations "The separation of relief and development is both
artificial and unhelpful. Not only are the recipients the same, but also
the underlying causes that create the need are the same\textemdash the vulnerability
of dryland communities." (Fitzgibbon 2012:52)}

Assuming the invariance of error distributions may be essential for causal inference, but the errors themselves need not be invariant. Graphs can be interpreted using conditional distributions, so that we can better address connections between the mathematical framework and causality in the world. The identification problem is posed in terms of conditionals. As will be seen, causal relationships cannot be inferred from a data set by running regressions unless there is substantial prior knowledge about the mechanisms that generated the data. There are few successful applications of graphical models, mainly because few causal pathways can be excluded on a priori grounds. The invariance conditions themselves remain to be assessed.},

Goals can be evaluated by asking program stakeholders why their goals are important to them. Systematic inquiry into goals also prepares the ground for setting consensual goals that express what stakeholders really care about. This article describes the method, provides a case illustration, offers guidelines for practice, and discusses the method in the context of the evaluation literature on goals and goal setting.},

The two tRNA genes are separated by a spacer segment highly homologous to a part of a unit which is repeated three times in the distal portion of the locus. This operon also contains coding capacity for a small basic protein. A genomic deletion of this locus was constructed and marked by a kanamycin resistance cassette. Deletion mutants exhibited a characteristic phenotype when cells were shifted from rich medium to minimal medium. The cells entered a transient lag phase, apparently resulting from specific glycine starvation. This phenotype involved stringent response and was therefore not observed in relA derivatives. The genomic deletion was complemented in trans by a plasmid-borne tyrT locus. From deletion mapping, it can be concluded that a product of the tyrT operon is responsible for complementation. However, neither the tRNA(1Tyr) nor the proposed basic protein is the complementation-competent entity.},

The purpose of the \{ITL\} project is to develop support for teacher-led innovation in a number of countries in the Balkans and elsewhere in Europe and to explore how this contributes to educational reform. Materials and techniques developed in the \{UK\} over many years are adapted and translated to enable partners in participating countries to support teachers as leaders of processes of innovation. Project team members in the participating countries have worked in collaboration with school principals and other facilitators to establish programmes that enable teachers to identify agendas and priorities for change, develop negotiated action plans and act strategically to embed innovations in their schools. Project team members have established the infrastructure of local knowledge networks through which teachers can come together to inspire each other and share accounts of their leadership of innovation. Vignettes and reports of teacher-led innovation have been captured and disseminated in order to build a body of knowledge about how to improve teaching and learning.}

  abstract = {ABSTRACTThe application of systemism, an innovative and user-friendly technique for generating lucid, graphic summaries of analytical arguments, can enhance the study of Canadian foreign policy. As research and pedagogy on Canada and international relations move forward, its content becomes increasingly vast and intellectually diverse. Systemism offers both a means and a method toward enhanced communication in the face of challenges posed by the rapid expansion of topics and the proliferation of new theories and terminology in the fast-paced world of the new millennium. This is the motivation for a special issue of CFPJ that will show systemism in action across a wide range of issues and locations. This introductory article will proceed in four sections. The first section provides an overview of the project as a whole. Section two introduces systemism as a graphic approach toward the communication of ideas. The third section applies systemism to convey the framework for analysis from the standard textbook in the field ? The Politics of Canadian Foreign Policy (Nossal, K. R., Roussel, S., \& Paquin, S. The politics of Canadian Foreign Policy. Queen?s policy studies series (4th ed.). Montreal: McGill-Queen?s University Press, 2015). Section four outlines the articles that follow in making up the special issue.},

As an important way to measure the similarity between pairwise graphs error-tolerantly, graph edit distance (GED) is the base of inexact graph matching. The research advance of GED is surveyed in order to provide a review of the existing literatures and offer some insights into the studies of GED. Since graphs may be attributed or non-attributed and the definition of costs for edit operations is various, the existing GED algorithms are categorized according to these two factors and described in detail. After these algorithms are analyzed and their limitations are identified, several promising directions for further research are proposed.}

A critical event is defined as a contingent event that is causally important for an outcome in a specific case. Using set-theoretic analysis, this article offers definitions and measurement tools for the study of contingency and causal importance in case study research. One set of tools consists of guidelines for using theoretical expectations to arrive at conclusions about the level of contingency of events. Another set of tools are guidelines for using counterfactual cases to determine the extent to which a given event is necessary and sufficient for a particular outcome in an individual case. Examples from comparative and international studies are used to illustrate the framework.},

In the past decade, the conversation about establishing causal claims has become prominent (and problematic). In response to this changing conversation about causality, we argue that evaluators need to take up some new ways of thinking about and examining causal claims in their practices, including (1) being responsive to the situation and intervention, (2) building relevant and defensible causal arguments, (3) being literate in multiple ways of thinking about causality, (4) being familiar with a range of causal designs and methods, (5) layering theories to explain causality at multiple levels; and (6) justifying the causal approach taken to multiple audiences. Drawing on recent literature, we discuss why and how evaluators can take up each of these ideas in practice. We conclude with considerations for evaluator training and future research.},

We aim to rearticulate the properties of social and causal complexity in their relationship to QCA. We first discuss the reasons why this relationship is not fully articulated in the current research. Rooted in a realist understanding of social emergence, we identify four possible strategies to bring social complexity back on focus when performing QCA: the use of thick case descriptions; the opening of the black box of conditions, by stacking and/or by developing them in a grounded manner; the integration of time in the method itself; and the combination of QCA with other, more time-sensitive methods.},

  abstract = {For much of the past two decades, expensive and often imported evidence-based programmes (EBPs) developed by clinician-researchers have been much in vogue in the family and parenting support field, as in many other areas of social provision. With their elaborate infrastructures, voluminous research bases and strict licensing criteria, they have seemed to offer certainty of success over less packaged, less well-evidenced locally developed approaches. Yet recently, evaluation research is showing that success is not assured. EBPs can and regularly do fail, at substantial cost to the public purse. In times of severe resource pressure, a pressing question is, therefore, whether lower cost, home-grown, practitioner-developed programmes-the sort often overlooked by policy-makers-can deliver socially significant and scientifically convincing outcomes at lower cost and at least on a par with their better resourced cousins. This paper shows how the application of techniques increasingly used in implementation science (the science of effective delivery) could help level the playing field. Processes for doing this including co-produced theory of change development and validation are illustrated with reference to the Family Links Ten Week Nurturing Programme (FLNP-10), a popular manualised group-based parenting support programme , designed and disseminated since the 1990s by a UK-based purveyor organisation. The paper draws out general principles for formulating and structuring strong theories of change for practice improvement projects. The work shows that novel application of implementation science-informed techniques can help home-grown programmes to compete scientifically by strengthening their design and delivery, and preparing the ground for better and fairer evaluation.}

  abstract = {This paper begins by distinguishing simple, complicated and complex problems. In simple problems like cooking by following a recipe, the recipe is essential. It is often tested to assure easy replication without the need for any particular expertise. Recipes produce standardized products and the best recipes give good results every time. Complicated problems, like sending a rocket to the moon, are different. Formulae or recipes are critical and necessary to resolve them but are often not sufficient. High levels of expertise in a variety of fields are necessary for success. Sending one rocket increases assurance that the next mission will be a success. In some critical ways, rockets are similar to each other and because of this there can be a relatively high degree of certainty of outcome. Raising a child, on the other hand, is a complex problem. Here, formulae have a much more limited application. Raising one child provides experience but no assurance of success with the next. Although expertise can contribute to the process in valuable ways, it provides neither necessary nor sufficient conditions to assure success. To some extent this is because every child is unique and must be understood as an individual. As a result there is always some uncertainty of the outcome. The complexity of the process and the lack of certainty do not lead us to the conclusion that it is impossible to raise a child. In this paper we argue that health care systems are complex, and that repairing them is a complex problem. Most attempts to intervene in Medicare (and in many other health care systems) treat them as if they were merely complicated. We demonstrate this failure of understanding by tracing the deterioration of Medicare through a series of complicated interventions to its present destabilized state. We identify the tensions that seem to represent intractable problems in the Canadian and other systems that elicit strong responses from warring ideologies and professions. We argue that many of these dilemmas can be dissolved if the system is viewed as complex. We then present a detailed account of complex adaptive systems using health care examples to indicate the explanatory power of the approach. The first of four clusters of characteristics focuses on theory. Complex systems are non-linear and exhibit a great deal of noise, tension and fluctuation as they interact with the rest of the environment. The causality cluster identifies such characteristics as mutual causality, emergent outcomes and probabilistic, uncertain and somewhat non-predictable outcomes. The evidence cluster describes how evidence in such systems considers factors that are typically ignored in complicated systems such as outliers, historical anomalies, and the nature of actual as opposed to idealized relationships. The planning cluster identifies the notion of decision as emergent from processes rather than events. It stresses the need for deeper understanding of actual practices and argues that big changes can occur from small interventions in complex systems. The paper continues by applying this understanding of complex systems to two case studies. The first draws lessons from the 2000 World Health Organization Report that ranked the French health care system as first in the world. The French system resisted the massive dislocation and destabilization that affected many other countries in the developed world by steadfastly maintaining its basic values and instituting only small-scale changes. Despite widely prophesied financial ruin, the French system today costs the same 9.4 percent of GDP as the Canadian one. The second case considers Brazils successful response to the AIDS epidemic, which deals with vi seemingly intractable problems of underdevelopment by dissolving the dilemmas. A distinction is made between the complicated questions asked by the World Bank and the complex question asked by Brazil. The paper concludes with the application of a complex systems approach to some of the Canadian problems and identifies what successful reform would look like. Most critically, complicated questions would be transformed into complex ones. The complicated question What are the structures we need to make the health care system sustainable? becomes the complex question How do we build on current structures and relationships to stabilize and enhance Medicare? The question Can we afford increasing care and treatment for an aging population? is best understood as How can we provide care and treatment that makes everyone feel that the system will be there should their family need it? The question What do we have to give up to support the most effective and advanced technology (or drugs)? would better be asked as How can we help health care institutions and professionals enhance the quality of services and innovation in technology and drugs? and, finally, How much should Canadians pay for their health care? might become How can Medicare contribute even more to the Canadian identity? We then proceed to suggest ways in which these four questions might begin to be answered. We argue that we have been trapped into a narrow way of defining and responding to current issues as if they were merely complicated. Success in answering more complex questions will begin the process of revitalizing the Canadian health care system. It will help resolve many of the tensions, which are now present in the system. The struggle to answer even the few questions we have posed can improve how health care is provided by stabilizing the system, recognizing the nature of health care knowledge and providing opportunities to improve services in a cost contained environment. These are clearly not all the questions, nor are we capable of providing all the answers. But this new perspective can help refine the questions to ask and provide indications of some of the kinds of answers we need.},

causal interest. Here the factor "years of education" does not tell us
whether we are interested in educated as the key causal variable. Hence we
need to convert years of education into the concept of educated, as

interval and ratio scales is that, in general, statistics only needs

are seen as occupying the bottom of the hierarchy of scales. If one has

"The results of standardization obviously depend on
the underlying data, not on anything related to the definition of the
concept being measured. A core guideline is to be wary of making
conceptualization decisions based on the empirical distribution of cases
(see chapter 9). The same, not surprisingly, is true of semantic
transformations. This is not to say that one should be completely immune
to empirical distributions. However, any transformation that depends
heavily or exclusively on the distribution of the data is problematic.
Statistical standardization certainly relies on the distribution of the
data and hence on a particular data set" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VKZ2IXGU?page=168}{Goertz

\par
"The UNDP recognizes the problems with setting
absolute minima and maxima, particularly based on empirical data over
time: The main problem with shifting the goal posts annually is that it
precludes meaningful comparisons over time: a country's HDI could change
from year to year for reasons that have nothing to do with its
performance. So, this year, we fix "normative" values for life expectancy,
adult literacy, mean years of schooling and income" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VKZ2IXGU?page=171}{Goertz

\par
"Interestingly enough, this outlier fix produces
basically the S-curve default of fuzzy logic. The popular min-max
standardization with "outlier correction" (i.e., cutting off the top and
bottom 2-5 percent) produces the fuzzy-logic default S-curve
transformation; however, the route to that transformation is radically
different: it is not semantics but data outlier problems" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VKZ2IXGU?page=171}{Goertz

"Hybrid concepts often go hand-in-hand with gray zone
concepts. Hybridity as discussed in this chapter takes two basic forms.
The first form is semantic hybridity: this means that two or more
different semantic domains are used to construct the list of defining
features" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VKZ2IXGU?page=208}{Goertz
2020:208})
\par
"Hybridity is much discussed in anthropology and
cultural studies as the combination of two different cultures in cultural
and postcolonial theory (e.g., Kraidy 2005) or the interaction of
international and local in critical peace studies (e.g., Mac Ginty 2010).
This chapter discusses as an example hybrid political regimes, e.g.,
competitive-authoritarian regimes, that have features of autocratic
regimes and features of democratic regimes, as well as "semipresidential"
which are hybrids of the concept pair parliamentary-presidential" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VKZ2IXGU?page=209}{Goertz
2020:209})
\par
"The hybridity of the gray zone comes out most
clearly when the gray zone is in the middle of a concept pair. A core
example in this chapter is "semipresidential" political systems. These are
a hybrid of parliamentary and presidential systems, which constitute the
concept pair.
Semipresidentialregimeshavefeaturesofbothsidesoftheconceptpair. This is
why the gray zone is frequently a hybrid zone: it combines some features,
but not all, of each side of the concept pair" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VKZ2IXGU?page=209}{Goertz
2020:209})
\par
"The second form of hybridity consists of structural
hybridity" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VKZ2IXGU?page=210}{Goertz
2020:210})
\par
"One interesting feature of the gray zone is the
extensive and normal use of negation in the list of defining features.
This arises because by definition the gray zone is not the positive pole
AND not the negative pole. Gray zone concepts are often hybrid structures
because between these two nots, one might use family resemblance
structures" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VKZ2IXGU?page=211}{Goertz
2020:211})
\par
"One form of hybridity involves taking features from
two different semantic domains and combining them somehow. In short, it as
an important form of hyphenated concepts because the terminology includes
reference to two concepts. One canonical example of this is
"competitive-authoritarian" regimes" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VKZ2IXGU?page=212}{Goertz
2020:212})

"terminology that pushes away from the positive pole.
This is a common part of natural language, such as "lukewarm" water, which

2020:212})
\par
"When comparing various concepts and measures one
usually finds that correlation coefficients are used to assess similarity.
This procedure often dramatically underestimates the dissimilarity of
measures. One reason for this is that observations at the ends of the
spectrum usually have more weight (in statistical terms more leverage;
Belsley et al. 1980) than those in the middle. It is often the case that
concepts and measures agree on the extreme cases since they are clear-cut
and easy to code, while at the same disagreeing frequently on cases in the
middle. Points in the middle often have a "half fish, half fowl" character
that makes them hard to categorize and classify" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VKZ2IXGU?page=215}{Goertz

\par
"In summary, a third guideline stresses the
following: Gray Zone Guideline III: In causal inference settings, e.g.,
statistical analyses, one must explicitly consider and justify the control
or comparison cases. For example, it might make sense for the population
under analysis to include only the gray zone and one pole as the contrast"

"I define a typology as a set of concepts" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VKZ2IXGU?page=231}{Goertz
2020:231})
\par
"There are two virtually uncontested rules for
constructing typologies: If typologies are to meet the norms for standard
categorical scales, the cells should be mutually exclusive and
collectively exhaustive. For the purpose of classification, it is
essential that these dual criteria be met; otherwise a given observed case
might fit in more than one cell, or might not fit in any cell. (Collier et
al. 2008, 157; emphasis is mine) In spite of the wide-ranging popularity
of typologies and these standard methodological rules, this chapter makes
the following argument: The standard mutually exclusive and exhaustive
rules for creating typologies are flawed" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VKZ2IXGU?page=232}{Goertz
2020:232})
\par
"Thereisoftenastrongtensionbetweennominaltypologiesandconceptual pairs

"twowaytypologiescaneasilybeseenasjusttwoconcepts,

typology just disappears" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VKZ2IXGU?page=233}{Goertz

\par
"The key point is just a restatement in brief of the
Scope Guideline in chapter 3: Do not use secondary scope in
conceptualization and measurement, and consequently in typologies as well.
Follow the Scope Guideline, i.e., use S." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VKZ2IXGU?page=235}{Goertz

"So the left-hand side becomes mental disorder and
the right-hand side is not-mental disorder. The types are the various
kinds of mental disorders and as we will see, there is a big category "no
type" that in the DSM becomes "not otherwise specified," which is a big
problem for the DSM. Thus to start one needs a concept of "mental
disorder." Here is the official definition" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VKZ2IXGU?page=236}{Goertz
2020:236})
\par
"Probably the reason for these missing types is that
they do not appear or are extremely rarely empirically. However, this
misses a key descriptive, theoretical, and causal point: Why are there no
cases of some hybrids such as oligarchymilitary and monarchy-party" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VKZ2IXGU?page=240}{Goertz
2020:240})
\par
"The conceptual part comes in because the same
symptom might be part of multiple disorders. This is what one might call
"conceptual comorbidity," which means that the individual has both
disorders at least partially by definition. "Empirical comorbidity" would
be if the symptoms of each disorder are completely separate but the
individual had the symptoms of both disorders." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/VKZ2IXGU?page=243}{Goertz

Abstract BACKGROUND: In recent years the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) has been extensively used as a short screening instrument, producing results that are comparable to longer versions of the GHQ. METHODS: The validity of the GHQ-12 was compared with the GHQ-28 in a World Health organization study of psychological disorders in general health care. Results are presented for 5438 patients interviewed in 15 centres using the primary care version of the Composite International Diagnostic Instrument, or CIDI-PC. RESULTS: Results were uniformly good, with the average area under the ROC curve 88, range from 83 to 95. Minor variations in the criteria used for defining a case made little difference to the validity of the GHQ, and complex scoring methods offered no advantages over simpler ones. The GHQ was translated into 10 other languages for the purposes of this study, and validity coefficients were almost as high as in the original language. There was no tendency for the GHQ to work less efficiently in developing countries. Finally gender, age and educational level are shown to have no significant effect on the validity of the GHQ. CONCLUSIONS: If investigators wish to use a screening instrument as a case detector, the shorter GHQ is remarkably robust and works as well as the longer instrument. The latter should only be preferred if there is an interest in the scaled scores provided in addition to the total score.}

Scenarios are a common technique for investigating the future, but can be time consuming and challenging to develop, particularly when more than a single organisation is involved. An approach is presented here which shifts the focus of scenario building from the company level to the sector level, whereby a range of organisations engage collectively on a topic of mutual importance. A rapid technique was developed, with simple scenarios being constructed in 2-4. h. This process was implemented in 13 multi-organisational workshops with participants from the construction and building industries, sectors which are traditionally short-term and reactive in their outlook. The resulting feedback, observations and experiences are discussed, together with examples of how the resultant scenarios have been applied. An example of causal map reflection (exposing an individual's causal map to others) is also presented, described and critiqued. It was found that the process was successful in engaging participants in thinking about and discussing the future, appreciating the interconnectivities of the related issues, and understanding the collective implications of their potential decisions, as well as facilitating the socialisation of participant thinking and the construction of collective futures. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

Systemic modelling has proved an efficient tool to study complex issues regarding farming systems, but it remains inefficient to support farmers in their system redesign processes. This paper describes and discusses a novel method to model livestock farming systems with groups of farmers to help them redesign their own systems. Modelling livestock farming systems at the farm scale with farmer groups is an original approach in livestock farming system modelling. Following a constructivist approach, our method involves working with farmers already involved in redesign processes and building causal maps according to their own representations, without using models previously created by scientists. Applying the method, we built two causal maps of livestock farming system operation, each one built with a group of five farmers including both those converting and converted to organic farming. Converting to organic farming was considered as one example of a redesign process. On the basis of a subjective assessment by both the participating farmers and researchers, and an analysis of map structures, we assessed the method's strengths and weaknesses. We considered that one of its main advantages lay in its collective dimension: sharing, comparing and questioning interested the participating farmers greatly; however, it requires good facilitation skills and suitable group composition. Furthermore, the formalising process identified, for example, vicious circles in system operation, which made the farmers think about solutions for breaking them. Finally, analysis of map structures identified similarities and differences between the two groups that were discussed with both of them during a final workshop; this activity continued farmers' self-reflection about their systems, which may help lead to innovative and more sustainable livestock farming systems.}

  abstract = {How do powerful states control international organizations (IOs)? In contrast to the conventional wisdom that treats weighted voting rules as the primary means that powerful states use to codify their asymmetric control in institutional design, we propose that funding rules are equally important. Our framework develops a logic of substitution whereby permissive earmark rules\textemdash that allow donors to stipulate how their contributions to an IO are used\textemdash are a design substitute for weighted voting from wealthy states' perspective. Whether asymmetric control is incorporated in design through voting or funding rules depends on whether egalitarian norms emphasizing political and legal equality, or shareholder norms emphasizing influence commensurate with financial power, govern voting and representation rights at the IO. Focusing on the domain of climate finance, we demonstrate that weighted voting rules are used at international climate finance institutions (ICFIs) associated with multilateral development banks, but that wealthy states pursued permissive earmark rules at ICFIs within the United Nations system where egalitarian norms are strong. In this way, powerful donors can exert control over resource allocation even when developing states appear to hold equal influence on governing bodies. In addition to providing a reassessment of how power translates into control at IOs, our framework offers insight into forum-shopping behavior and sheds light on substitution dynamics that involve other dimensions of design across a range of issue areas.},

Although these cognitive maps have proven useful as a method to systematically collect and represent knowledge, questions about the cognitive theories which support these assumptions remain. Detailed instructions about how to interpret FCM, especially in terms of collective knowledge and the construction of FCM by non-traditional `experts', are also currently lacking. Drawing from the social science literature and the recent application of FCM as a tool for collaborative decision-making, in this chapter we attempt to clarify some of these ambiguities. Specifically, we address a number of theoretical issues regarding the use of Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping to represent individual ``mental models'' as well as their usefulness for comparing and characterizing the aggregated beliefs and knowledge of a community.},

Characterizing the differences between knowledge systems, however, is not easily accomplished. There are few metrics readily available to compare one knowledge system to another. This paper characterizes knowledge about a model SES, the summer flounder fishery in the mid-Atlantic, to evaluate differences and similarities in the structural and functional characteristics of stakeholder mental models. To measure these differences, we collected Fuzzy-Logic Cognitive Maps (FCM) from several stakeholder groups (managers, scientists, harvesters, pre and post harvest sectors, and environmental NGOs) which comprise social agents within the SES. We then compared stakeholder groups' maps using graph theory indices to characterize the structure and function of the model system. We then combined stakeholder FCM to generate a community map which represents a theoretical model of the combination of stakeholder knowledge. Our study indicates that while there may be benefits to integrating knowledge in resource decision-making, it also has costs associated with it. Although integrating knowledge may increase structural knowledge, it may also decrease precision in understanding of how a system functions and be overly focused on driving components which would reduce the ability of decision-makers to predict system reaction to a decision or policy plan.}

Two important counter-narratives\textemdash ``Covid is unequivocally airborne'' and ``Everyone generates aerosols; everyone is vulnerable''\textemdash{} were sidelined despite strong evidence to support them. Tragic consequences of the flawed policy narrative unfolded as social dramas. For example, droplet precautions became ritualised; care home residents died in their thousands; public masking became a libertarian lightning rod; and healthcare settings became occupational health battlegrounds. In a discussion, we call for bold action to ensure that the science of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is freed from the shackles of historical errors, scientific vested interests, ideological manipulation and policy satisficing.}

We sought to understand the multiple influences on behaviour (hence risks to metabolic health) of South Asian mothers and their unborn child, theorise how these influences interact and build over time, and inform the design of culturally congruent, multi-level interventions. Methods: Our sample for this qualitative study was 45 women of Bangladeshi, Indian, Sri Lankan, or Pakistani origin aged 21-45 years with a history of diabetes in pregnancy, recruited from diabetes and antenatal services in two deprived London boroughs. Overall, 17 women shared their experiences of diabetes, pregnancy, and health services in group discussions and 28 women gave individual narrative interviews, facilitated by multilingual researchers, audiotaped, translated, and transcribed. Data were analysed using the constant comparative method, drawing on sociological and narrative theories. Results: Key storylines (over-arching narratives) recurred across all ethnic groups studied. Short-term storylines depicted the experience of diabetic pregnancy as stressful, difficult to control, and associated with negative symptoms, especially tiredness. Taking exercise and restricting diet often worsened these symptoms and conflicted with advice from relatives and peers. Many women believed that exercise in pregnancy would damage the fetus and drain the mother's strength, and that eating would be strength-giving for mother and fetus. These short-term storylines were nested within medium-term storylines about family life, especially the cultural, practical, and material constraints of the traditional South Asian wife and mother role and past experiences of illness and healthcare, and within longer-term storylines about genetic, cultural, and material heritage - including migration, acculturation, and family memories of food insecurity. While peer advice was familiar, meaningful, and morally resonant, health education advice from clinicians was usually unfamiliar and devoid of cultural meaning. Conclusions: 'Behaviour change' interventions aimed at preventing and managing diabetes in South Asian women before and during pregnancy are likely to be ineffective if delivered in a socio-cultural vacuum. Individual education should be supplemented with community-level interventions to address the socio-material constraints and cultural frames within which behavioural 'choices' are made.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Qualitative research methods are increasingly being used across disciplines because of their ability to help investigators understand the perspectives of participants in their own words. However, qualitative analysis is a laborious and resource-intensive process. To achieve depth, researchers are limited to smaller sample sizes when analyzing text data. One potential method to address this concern is natural language processing (NLP). Qualitative text analysis involves researchers reading data, assigning code labels, and iteratively developing findings; NLP has the potential to automate part of this process. Unfortunately, little methodological research has been done to compare automatic coding using NLP techniques and qualitative coding, which is critical to establish the viability of NLP as a useful, rigorous analysis procedure. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the utility of a traditional qualitative text analysis, an NLP analysis, and an augmented approach that combines qualitative and NLP methods. METHODS: We conducted a 2-arm cross-over experiment to compare qualitative and NLP approaches to analyze data generated through 2 text (short message service) message survey questions, one about prescription drugs and the other about police interactions, sent to youth aged 14-24 years. We randomly assigned a question to each of the 2 experienced qualitative analysis teams for independent coding and analysis before receiving NLP results. A third team separately conducted NLP analysis of the same 2 questions. We examined the results of our analyses to compare (1) the similarity of findings derived, (2) the quality of inferences generated, and (3) the time spent in analysis. RESULTS: The qualitative-only analysis for the drug question (n=58) yielded 4 major findings, whereas the NLP analysis yielded 3 findings that missed contextual elements. The qualitative and NLP-augmented analysis was the most comprehensive. For the police question (n=68), the qualitative-only analysis yielded 4 primary findings and the NLP-only analysis yielded 4 slightly different findings. Again, the augmented qualitative and NLP analysis was the most comprehensive and produced the highest quality inferences, increasing our depth of understanding (ie, details and frequencies). In terms of time, the NLP-only approach was quicker than the qualitative-only approach for the drug (120 vs 270 minutes) and police (40 vs 270 minutes) questions. An approach beginning with qualitative analysis followed by qualitative- or NLP-augmented analysis took longer time than that beginning with NLP for both drug (450 vs 240 minutes) and police (390 vs 220 minutes) questions. CONCLUSIONS: NLP provides both a foundation to code qualitatively more quickly and a method to validate qualitative findings. NLP methods were able to identify major themes found with traditional qualitative analysis but were not useful in identifying nuances. Traditional qualitative text analysis added important details and context.},

We introduce the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT), a dataset that addresses the need for continuously updated, readily usable and comparable information on policy measures. From 1 January 2020, the data capture government policies related to closure and containment, health and economic policy for more than 180 countries, plus several countries' subnational jurisdictions. Policy responses are recorded on ordinal or continuous scales for 19 policy areas, capturing variation in degree of response. We present two motivating applications of the data, highlighting patterns in the timing of policy adoption and subsequent policy easing and reimposition, and illustrating how the data can be combined with behavioural and epidemiological indicators. This database enables researchers and policymakers to explore the empirical effects of policy responses on the spread of COVID-19 cases and deaths, as well as on economic and social welfare.},

Most theory-based approaches are program theory driven and some are stakeholder oriented as well. Practically, all of the latter fuse the program perceptions of the various stakeholder groups into one unitary program theory. The TSE model keeps the program theories of the diverse stakeholder groups apart from each other and from the program theory embedded in the institutionalized intervention itself. This represents, the authors argue, an important clarification and extension of the standard theory-based evaluation. The TSE model is elaborated to enhance theory-based evaluation of interventions characterized by conflicts and competing program theories. The authors argue that especially in evaluations of complex and complicated multilevel and multisite interventions, the presence of competing theories is likely and the TSE model may prove useful.}

We also describe how quantitative and qualitative methodologies can be and have been combined in studies seeking to make causal claims, highlighting some of the key research design decisions in integrating qualitative and quantitative methodologies.

This study tests an online, computer-mediated participatory system modelling platform (STICKE) and associated methods for collating and analysing its outputs.

Participants successfully completed the online modelling activity, and created causal diagrams consistent with expectations.

STICKE is an accessible tool that enabled participants to create causal diagrams online. Methods trialled in this study provide a protocol for combining and summarising individual causal diagrams that was perceived to be useful by the participant group. STICKE supports communities to consider and respond to complex problems at a local level, which is cornerstone of sustainable effective prevention. Understanding how communities perceive their own health challenges will be important to better support and inform locally owned prevention efforts.},

The user adds variables that they perceive to be drivers of the complex

the user enters causal relationships between determinants (including the
specification of relationship polarity, using system dynamics modelling
conventions). The user adds factors and connections in any desired order.
STICKE provides a function which automates the process of untangling the
connection circle into a more conventional causal diagram. The untangling
process is led by a modified force-layout algorithm that analyses model
structure and reconfigures the map based on the objectives of minimising
crossover of connection arrows, and emphasising feedback loops. The
algorithm-driven approach achieves varying levels of "completeness"
depending on the number of factors present when switching from connection
circle to diagram view, the density of interconnections, and the personal
preference of the user. Figure 5 provides examples of the connection

  abstract = {With 28\% of Australia's population having a culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) background, the health system faces an increasing challenge to provide accessible and culturally competent health care. The view that all CALD communities are homogenous and solutions can be developed for the entire nation is detrimental. Despite available health services, CALD communities are reluctant to use them due to cultural differences, perceived racism and misunderstandings leading to the existing health disparities. Therefore, gathering data from four prominent CALD communities, such as the Sudanese, Afghani, Pacific Islander and Burmese communities in Logan, Queensland, about how they perceive and use health services can provide insightful information towards development of a service model that will better suit these CALD communities. The objective of the study was to examine the extent to which four prominent CALD communities (Sudanese, Afghani, Pacific Islander and Burmese) access and use health services in Logan, Queensland. Six focus group interviews using interpreters were conducted in English with Sudanese, Afghani, Pacific Islander and Burmese people. The results indicated that even long-standing CALD communities, such as the Pacific Islander people, were unfamiliar with health services and experienced difficulties accessing appropriate health care. Most wanted doctors to use traditional healing methods alongside orthodox medicine, but did not feel respected for their beliefs. Language difficulties impeded communication with health professionals who were hindered by ineffective use of interpreters. In conclusion, a clear role for bilingual community-based navigators was identified by CALD participants to address concerns about the health system, and to improve accessibility and health service usage.},

In all cases, implications for practicing evaluators should be clearly identified. Examples of contributions include, but are not limited to, reviews of new developments in evaluation, descriptions of a current evaluation study, critical reviews of some area of evaluation practice, and presentations of important new techniques. Manuscripts should follow APA format for references and style. Most submissions are 20\textendash 30 double-spaced typewritten pages in length; longer articles will also be published if their importance to AJE readers age is judged to be high. ABSTRACT Although use is a core construct in the field of evaluation, neither the change processes through which evaluation affects attitudes, beliefs, and actions, nor the interim outcomes that lie between the evaluation and its ultimate goal\textemdash social betterment\textemdash have been sufficiently developed. We draw a number of these change mechanisms, such as justification, persuasion, and policy diffu-sion, from the social science research literature, and organize them into a framework that has three levels: individual, interpersonal, and collective. We illustrate how these change processes can be linked together to form " pathways " or working hypotheses that link evaluation processes to outcomes that move us along the road toward the goal of social betterment. In addition, we join with Kirkhart (2000) in moving beyond use, to focus our thinking on evaluation influence. Influence, combined with the set of mechanisms and interim outcomes presented here, offers a better way for thinking about, communicating, and adding to the evidence base about the consequences of evaluation and the relationship of evaluation to social betterment.},

Building on that research, the authors applied Integrative Proposition Analysis to visualize, integrate, and assess the quality and usefulness of knowledge gained from the NMAC (formerly National Minority AIDS Council) Strong Communities evaluation. Purpose: Demonstrate an innovative method to rigorously integrate and strengthen knowledge gained from evaluation and to encourage discussion of future directions for developing stronger theories for more effective evaluation and more effective action. Setting: Birmingham, Alabama. Intervention: A project to identify local strategies for community-based organizations and community health centers that serve African American and Latinx gay and bisexual men and transgender women to collaboratively meet HIV-related community needs. Research Design: The researchers applied Integrative Propositional Analysis to integrate and map concepts and causal connections emerging from the evaluation findings. The authors then analyzed the resulting map to identify topmentioned concepts, better understood concepts, reinforcing loops, and knowledge gaps. Data Collection and Analysis: Integrative Propositional Analysis applied to a literature review and stakeholder interview transcripts collected for the evaluation. Findings: Integrating literature and interview results helped to identify several actions where providers of HIV-related services could increase their impact on combating the HIV epidemic among the communities they serve. The authors also identified a reinforcing loop; this shows opportunity to improve two desired outcomes by increasing one. In addition, the authors identified blank spots on the map; these show where additional research could strengthen the quality and usefulness of the mapped knowledge.},

The framework-Bayesian integration of quantitative and qualitative data (BIQQ)-allows researchers to draw causal inferences from combinations of correlational (cross-case) and process-level (within-case) observations, given prior beliefs about causal effects, assignment propensities, and the informativeness of different kinds of causal-process evidence. In addition to posterior estimates of causal effects, the framework yields updating on the analytical assumptions underlying correlational analysis and process tracing. We illustrate the BIQQ approach with two applications to substantive issues that have received significant quantitative and qualitative treatment in political science: the origins of electoral systems and the causes of civil war. Finally, we demonstrate how the framework can yield guidance on multimethod research design, presenting results on the optimal combinations of qualitative and quantitative data collection under different research conditions.},

On the other hand, the conventional GHQ and the CGHQ score appear equally sensitive to a number of socio-demographic variables, including social class, marital status and employment. An important finding is that the two methods identify different individuals as cases. Compared with the GHQ, the CGHQ identifies a higher proportion of the middle-aged. The implications of these findings with respect to the optimal method of scoring the GHQ are discussed.},

(IFRC 2014:5)"it's important to distinguish the crisis, when it comes,
from chronic background vulnerability" (IFRC 2014:7)"The early warning
system in the ASALs must provide the means to differentiate a heightened
risk of short-term, acute crisis from this chronic baseline. T" (IFRC
2014:7)"Early warning systems have traditionally been 'owned' by
humanitarian actors. This was understandable in terms of response, but
makes less sense in terms of resilience thinking. increasingly, early
warning capacity is owned by governments, formally linked to the
coordination structure, and supported by a legal framework. Development
partners are increasingly involved in funding these early warning systems,
but are less involved in supporting the other components of the early
action system." (IFRC 2014:10)"The first of these areas is in
understanding the specific impact that the projected conditions will have
at the household level, where people have different resources and
capacities, different livelihoods and coping strategies, and where the
context is changing rapidly: even if we could calculate impact at the
household level, our old models may no longer apply. The second area
relates to the complexities of human interaction: it is not possible to
predict with certainty how markets will react to variation in price,
quality and availability, or changes to seasonal migration patterns, or
how different groups will interact with each other; the potential for
conflict over limited resources like water points and pasture." (IFRC

Programme (ALP) is a climate change adaptation programme implemented by
CARE in Kenya, Ghana, Mozambique and Niger. in Garissa, Kenya, ALP is

I also discuss the potential outcome framework developed by Rubin and coauthors, building on work by Neyman. I then discuss the relative merits of these approaches for empirical work in economics, focusing on the questions each answer well, and why much of the the work in economics is closer in spirit to the potential outcome framework.},

In the last two decades, much research has been done on the econometric and statistical analysis of such causal effects. This recent theoretical literature has built on, and combined features of, earlier work in both the statistics and econometrics literatures. It has by now reached a level of maturity that makes it an important tool in many areas of empirical research in economics, including labor economics, public finance, development economics, industrial organization, and other areas of empirical microeconomics. In this review, we discuss some of the recent developments. We focus primarily on practical issues for empirical researchers, as well as provide a historical overview of the area and give references to more technical research.},

The methodology used for the review includes a systematic search on electronic databases for peer-reviewed published literature. We categorize studies according to level of analysis (single and multilevel) and examine whether studies reveal a significant health impact of individual and area level social capital. We compare the study conclusions according to the country's degrees of economic egalitarianism. Regardless of study design, our findings indicate that a positive association (fixed effect) exists between social capital and better health irrespective of countries degree of egalitarianism. However, we find that the between-area variance (random effect) in health tends to be lower in more egalitarian countries than in less egalitarian countries. Our tentative conclusion is that an association between social capital and health at the individual level is robust with respect to the degree of egalitarianism within a country. Area level or contextual social capital may be less salient in egalitarian countries in explaining health differences across places.},

This study tested the relationship between causal understanding (ratio of root causes correctly/incorrectly identified, number of correctly identified root-cause links explaining how root causes directly/indirectly impact final outcomes) and three attributes observed in students' causal maps (total links, temporal flow, lateral position of final outcome) that students produced before and after online discussions on noted similarities and differences between students' causal maps. The findings suggest that: (a) causal understanding can be adversely affected if students are instructed before group discussion to temporally sequence nodes to flow from left to right and to position the outcome node farther away from the left edge of the map relative to other nodes in the map; (b) causal understanding following group discussion can be increased by instructing students to minimize the number of causal links and create a map with temporally flow; (c) promoting temporal flow following discussion may be the most effective means of helping students to identify root causes; and (d) instructing students to minimize the number of links following discussion may be the most effective means to helping students explain root causes directly/indirectly impact outcomes. These findings provide insights on what processes and constraints can be formalized and integrated into causal mapping software when used as an instructional and assessment tool.},

This paper reviews this work and identifies good practices to integrate qualitative methods into quantitative impact evaluations (IEs) and systematic reviews (SRs). Using recent literature on the characteristics of such practices, we developed two tools to assess the methodological rigour and mixed methods integration of 40 IEs and 7 SRs, drawing upon previous approaches. Our findings are that successful mixed methods quantitative impact evaluations: (1) provide a clear rationale for integration of methods; (2) deploy multidisciplinary teams; (3) provide adequate documentation; and (4) acknowledge limitations to the generalisability of qualitative and quantitative findings. Successful integration tended to improve mixed methods impact evaluations by collecting better data to inform the study design and findings, which helped contextualise quantitative findings. Our main observation on the integration of mixed methods in the systematic reviews is that mixed methods systematic reviews bringing together literatures that answer different questions can go beyond the `sum of their parts' to provide holistic answers about development effectiveness. The findings of this study inform several recommendations to improve the conduct and reporting of mixed methods impact evaluations and systematic reviews.},

  abstract = {Empirical evidence from various social and educational contexts suggests that private tutoring (\{PT\}) services are more accessible to pupils from families of more advantaged socio-economic status. This, in turn, reflects and/or exacerbates both social and educational inequalities, an outcome that has been shown through previous research in Croatia and Bosnia \$\textbackslash backslash\$\& Herzegovina. The present chapter explores educational stakeholders' perspectives on the differences in patterns of \{PT\} use by pupils from different socio-economic backgrounds. Secondly, it explores the relevance educational stakeholders assign to the issue of social equity related to \{PT\} and their willingness and capacity to address this issue. Data were collected using individual semi-structured interviews and focus groups with selected educational stakeholders. Criterion and purposive sampling were used to identify educational stakeholders from governmental, political, professional, parental, educational, media and academic spheres. The findings indicate that, in both countries, social equity issues associated with \{PT\} are mainly related to differences in the quality, frequency, continuity and purpose of \{PT\} services. Issues of social equity, as they relate to \{PT\}, emerged as a marginal concern. In addition, the findings from both countries indicate a lack of readiness and ability amongst educational stakeholders to adequately deal with and address issues of social equity. The findings also revealed a substantial homogeneity of perspectives between and within the two countries.},

(2527)Estimating the Multilevel Rasch Model:

Abstract:
\par
Traditional Rasch estimation of the item and
student parameters via marginal maximum likelihood, joint maximum
likelihood or conditional maximum likelihood, assume individuals in
clustered settings are uncorrelated and items within a test that share a
grouping structure are also uncorrelated. These assumptions are often
violated, particularly in educational testing situations, in which
students are grouped into classrooms and many test items share a common
grouping structure, such as a content strand or a reading passage.
Consequently, one possible approach is to explicitly recognize the
clustered nature of the data and directly incorporate random effects to
account for the various dependencies. This article demonstrates how the
multilevel Rasch model can be estimated using the functions in R for
mixed-effects models with crossed or partially crossed random effects. We
demonstrate how to model the following hierarchical data structures: a)
individuals clustered in similar settings (e.g., classrooms, schools), b)
items nested within a particular group (such as a content strand or a
reading passage), and c) how to estimate a teacher x content strand
interaction.}

The normality of a stimulus is evaluated by comparing it with the norms that it evokes after the fact, rather than to precomputed expectations. Norm theory is applied in analyses of the enhanced emotional response to events that have abnormal causes, of the generation of predictions and inferences from observations of behavior, and of the role of norms in causal questions and answers.

Kalayjian, as the MHOP Director, uses a Six-Step Bio-Psychosocial and Spiritual model comprised of six steps when treating individuals and families after a disaster. The following are the six-steps: (1) levels of distress are assessed utilizing the revised Reaction Index Scale (RIS/R), (2) discovery of memories \& expression of feelings are encouraged to help survivors discuss the sequence of events in a manner free of anger and blame, (3) provide empathy and validation for survivors who are normally full of guilt, fear, and sadness, (4) encourage discovery and expression of positive meaning, (5) provide didactic information sensitive to their developmental stage and crucial to their healing since may blame themselves, and (6) provide instructions for diaphragmatic breathing and physical relief to normalize respiratory patterns (Kalayjian, 2002). In this paper, the author presents a case study working with a family in post tsunami Sri Lanka. The use of the Six-step Model will be demonstrated and recommendation for further research will be discussed.},

This paper uses evidence from field work completed on implementing settlement and shelter in post-tsunami Aceh and Sri Lanka to examine whether or not the theory and practice of `build back better' were witnessed. Focusing on settlement and shelter, four areas are examined: (i) safety, security, and livelihoods; (ii) how post-disaster settlement and shelter could have an improved connection with permanent housing and communities (the `transition to what?' question); (iii) fairness and equity; and (iv) connecting relief and development by tackling root causes of vulnerability. Based on the field work, addressing these four areas is suggested as how `build back better' could be implemented. Recommendations are 1. Community involvement is essential, but that does not necessarily mean community control. 2. Organizations involved in implementing transitional settlement and shelter need to consider their capacity and links to other sectors. 3. Thinking ahead is necessary by integrating relief and development through long-term planning and disaster risk reduction. Overall, `building back safer'might be a preferable tagline to `building back better' because `better' has multiple interpretations, many of which caused further problems, whereas `safer' provides a clearer goal on which to focus for post-disaster settlement and shelter.},

The analysis is carried out within an econometric model of population health in 19 countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries using panel data covering three different time periods. Social capital is measured by the proportion of people who say that that they generally trust other people and by membership in voluntary associations. The model performs well in explaining health outcomes. We find very little statistically significant evidence that the standard indicators of social capital have a positive effect on population health. By contrast, per capita income and the proportion of health expenditure financed by the government are both significantly and positively associated with better health outcomes. The paper casts doubt upon the widely accepted hypothesis that social capital has a positive effect on health and illustrates the importance of testing this kind of hypothesis in an extended model.},

Geweke's autoregressive formulation of Granger causality is used to compute linear transfer entropy, and Schreiber's general, non-parametric, information-theoretic formulation is used to quantify nonlinear transfer entropy. We first validate these measures against synthetic data. Then we apply these measures to detect statistical causality between social sentiment changes and cryptocurrency returns. We validate results by performing permutation tests by shuffling the time series, and calculate the Z -score. We also investigate different approaches for partitioning in non-parametric density estimation which can improve the significance. Using these techniques on sentiment and price data over a 48-month period to August 2018, for four major cryptocurrencies, namely bitcoin (BTC), ripple (XRP), litecoin (LTC) and ethereum (ETH), we detect significant information transfer, on hourly timescales, with greater net information transfer from sentiment to price for XRP and LTC, and instead from price to sentiment for BTC and ETH. We report the scale of nonlinear statistical causality to be an order of magnitude larger than the linear case.},

"What is systemic change? The DCED Standard recommends
that programmes assess the changes that they facilitate in the system or
market, often referred to as systemic change. This enables practitioners
to learn more about the market system, track the emerging results of their
intervention, and continually adapt their approach to increase their
impact. It will also enable programmes to assess and report the full range
of benefits that they are contributing to, demonstrating the value of a

describes centrality as a measure for determining the importance of nodes
in an FCM. Centrality of a concept C j in a cognitive map is given by the
sum of the number of concepts causally impinging (directly or indirectly)
on C j , and the number of concepts causally impinged on by C j" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PTCSZSTR?page=6}{Khan and Quaddus

2004:469})
\par
"In other words, the indirect effect of concept Ci on
concept C j is given by the weight of the weakest causal link in the path
leading from Ci to C j . The total effect of concept Ci on concept C j
over all the paths leading from Ci to C j amounts to the strongest of the

"matrix multiplication mentioned in section on
Applications of FCMS in Decision Support). This interaction continues
until: 1. The FCM stabilises to a fixed state (the fixed-point attractor),
in which some of the concepts are 'on' (or, in case of a continuous
transformation function, have relatively large values), and others are
not. 2. The FCM keeps cycling through the same set of output states (the
limit cycle). 3. The FCM exhibits unstable behaviour (the chaotic
attractor) and keeps changing state instead of stabilising as in (1) and
(2) above. This third possibility exists only when a continuous valued
transformation function is used for calculating concept node outputs." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PTCSZSTR?page=8}{Khan and Quaddus

"As the predecessor of FCMs, cognitive maps have been
applied with different objectives in decision support environments since
the 1970s (Eden and Ackermann 1998; Tsadiras and Margaritis 1995a). FCMs
can exhibit enhanced usefulness through their ability to handle imprecise
information, to evolve dynamically through recurrent feedback and the
facility to combine knowledge bases through the union of a number of FCMs"

"The procedures for combining FCMs are
described in Kosko (1988). Generally, combination of FCMs involves summing
the matrices that represent the different FCMs. In all probability,
different versions of an FCM specific to the same domain will consist of
an unequal number of concepts. This results in these FCM matrices having
different sizes. This requires augmentation of some matrices to ensure
conformity in addition" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PTCSZSTR?page=11}{Khan and Quaddus

representing their influence on other nodes, should be considered as more
suitable for removal, as their absence is likely to affect relatively few

first for removal. The causal influence of a node is measured by summing

There are many ways identified in the literature for carrying out assisted valuation. One way of assisting the valuation process is the use of evaluative rubrics. This practice-based article unpacks the learnings of a group of evaluators who have used evaluative rubrics to grapple with this challenge. Compared to their previous practice, evaluative rubrics have allowed them to surface and deal with values in a more transparent way. In their experience when evaluators and evaluation stakeholders get clearer about values, evaluative judgments become more credible and warrantable.},

This article argues that when addressing an evaluative question about an economic problem (the merit, worth, or significance of resource use), economic analysis can enhance evaluation but is usually insufficient to fully answer the evaluative question and that a stronger approach would involve explicit evaluative reasoning, supported by judicious use of economic and other methods. An overarching theoretical framework is proposed, and implications for evaluation practice are discussed.}

Median completion time (including repeat items to assess immediate test-retest reliability) was 22.7 minutes, and centrality measures showed excellent immediate test-retest reliability. Networks were highly idiosyncratic, but worrying and ruminating were the most central items for a third of respondents. Second, 50 psychotherapists rated the clinical utility of Perceived Causal Networks visualizations. Ninety-six percent rated the networks as clinically useful, and the information in the individual visualizations was judged to contain 47\% of the information typically collected during a psychotherapy assessment phase. Future studies should individualize networks further and evaluate the validity of perceived causal relations.},

  abstract = {This article offers a theory-of-change framework for social justice advocacy. It describes broad outcome categories against which activists, donors and evaluators can assess progress (or lack thereof) in an ongoing manner: changes in organisational capacity, base of support, alliances, data and analysis from a social justice perspective, problem definition and potential policy options, visibility, public norms, and population level impacts. Using these for evaluation enables activists and donors to learn from and rethink their strategies as the political context and/or actors change over time. The paper presents a case study comparing factors that facilitated reproductive rights policy wins during the transition from apartheid to democracy in South Africa and factors that undermined their implementation in the post-apartheid period. It argues that after legal and policy victories had been won, failure to maintain strong organizations and continually rethink strategies contributed to the loss of government focus on and resources for implementation of new policies. By implication, evaluating effectiveness only by an actual policy change does not allow for ongoing learning to ensure appropriate strategies. It also fails to recognise that a policy win can be overturned and needs vigilant monitoring and advocacy for implementation. This means that funding and organising advocacy should seldom be undertaken as a short-term proposition. It also suggests that the building and maintenance of organisational and leadership capacity is as important as any other of the outcome categories in enabling success. \textcopyright{} 2011 Foundation Review.},

  abstract = {Understanding the extent to which an intervention `works' can provide compelling evidence to decision-makers, although without an accompanying explanation of how an intervention works, this evidence can be difficult to apply in other settings, ultimately impeding its usefulness in making judicious and evidence-informed decisions. In this paper, we describe causal chain analysis as involving the development of a logic model, which outlines graphically a hypothesis of how an intervention leads to a change in an outcome. This logic model is then used to anchor subsequent decisions in the systematic review process, including decisions on synthesis. In this paper, we outline the steps taken in building a logic model, which usually consists of a series of boxes depicting intervention components and processes, outputs, and outcomes with arrows depicting connecting relationships. The nature of these connecting relationships and their basis in causality are considered, through a focus on complex causal relationships and the way in which contextual factors about the intervention setting or population may moderate these. We also explore the way in which specific combinations of intervention components may lead to successful interventions. Evidence synthesis techniques are discussed in the context of causal chain analysis, and their usefulness in exploring different parts of the causal chain or different types of relationship. The approaches outlined in this paper aim to assist systematic reviewers in producing findings that are useful to decision-makers and practitioners, and in turn, help to confirm existing theories or develop entirely new ways of understanding how interventions effect change.},

The involvement of parents in the life of schools and their participation in school activities and decision- making is a major vehicle for constructing shared goals and co-ordinated practices. A large-scale study was conducted in ten \{SEE\} countries: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Romania and Serbia. The analysis of legislative acts and other documentation revealed that educational bodies with parental participation are regularly found at the school level, such as school boards and parent councils, while representation is negligible above the school level. Schools in all \{SEE\} countries have school boards with decision-making power in which parents also participate, with varying shares, although their number never prevails. A total of 11,125 parents were surveyed with structured face-to-face interviews, selected by stratified random sampling. The stratification was undertaken according to relevant geographical regions and by the location of the community served by the school (urban/rural). 30 schools were selected from each country and between 20 and 40 parents were randomly chosen from each school, proportional to the size of the school as well as five parents' representatives. In each country, a booster sample of parents was interviewed from two additional schools in communities which contained a high proportion of inhabitants who are Roma (except in Moldova, where other excluded communities were targeted). The main structure of the sample (including the main sample, parent representatives samples and Roma booster samples) was the following: \textbullet{} Sample A (mainstream \textendash{} regular parents sample): 9058 \textbullet{} Sample E (Roma parents from the excluded parents sample): 504 \textbullet{} Sample B (parents' representatives sample): 1354 \textbullet{} Parent representatives from Sample E school: 85 \textbullet{} Sample E (non-Roma parents from the excluded parents sample): 124 The questionnaire which was the basis for the interviews captured the following data: \textbullet{} socio-economic data on the child's family (wealth indicator, education level, education aspirations etc.) and basic information about the child (age, gender, school achievement etc.); \textbullet{} a report on participation in school life, which combined Epstein's dimensions of participation (whether the school invites parents to participate according to each dimension) with basic characteristics of the participation process (how parents feel about it, do they participate if invited, do they assess it as useful, are they motivated, do they feel competent etc.); \textbullet{} mediating variables \textendash{} self-reports on the motivation of parents, their beliefs about school-parent partnerships and perceptions of school openness, and of the work of the parent representatives; and \textbullet{} a self-assessment of parents' satisfaction with the child's well-being and progress at school, the communication with the school and with the influence the parent can exert.

In particular, mass drug administration programmes only work to reduce the prevalence of a disease if significant proportions of the target population take the drug in question. In such cases, knowledge of the factors most likely to lead to high levels of compliance is crucial to the programme's success. Existing models of compliance tend to either address interpersonal, organizational or psychological causes independently. Here, the authors present a formal method for analysing relevant factors in the situational context of the compliant behaviour, identifying how these factors may interact within the individual. This method was developed from semantic network analysis, augmented to include environmental and demographic variables to show causal linkages - hence the name 'causal chain mapping'. The ability of this method to provide significant insight into the actual behaviour of individuals is demonstrated with examples from a mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis in Alor District, Indonesia. The use of this method is likely to help identify key components influencing compliance, and thus make any public health programme reliant on the adoption of novel behaviours more effective. \textcopyright{} The Author 2011; all rights reserved.},

The Institute of Medicine has called for randomized studies directly comparing approaches that do and do not consider culture. METHODS: In a randomized trial, 1227 lower-income African-American women from 10 urban public health centers were assigned to either a usual care control group, or to receive a series of six women's health magazines with content tailored to each individual. By random assignment, these magazines were generated from either behavioral construct tailoring (BCT), culturally relevant tailoring (CRT) or both (BCT + CRT). The CRT magazines were based on four cultural constructs: religiosity, collectivism, racial pride, and time orientation. All tailored magazines sent to women ages 40-65 promoted use of mammography; magazines sent to women ages 18-39 promoted fruit and vegetable (FV) intake. Analyses examined changes from baseline to 18-month follow-up in use of mammography and servings of FV consumed daily. RESULTS: Women receiving BCT + CRT magazines were more likely than those in the BCT, CRT, and control groups to report getting a mammogram (76\% vs. 65\% vs. 64\% vs. 55\%, respectively), and had greater increases in FV servings consumed daily (+0.96 vs. + 0.43 vs. + 0.25 vs. + 0.59). CONCLUSIONS: Systematically integrating culture into tailored cancer prevention and control interventions may enhance their effectiveness in diverse populations.},

  abstract = {An effective state is essential to achieving socio-economic and sustainable development. With the advent of globalization, there are growing pressures on governments and organizations around the world to be more responsive to the demands of internal and external stakeholders for good governance, accountability and transparency, greater development effectiveness, and delivery of tangible results. Governments, parliaments, citizens, the private sector, NGOs, civil society, international organizations and donors are among the stakeholders interested in better performance. As demands for greater accountability and real results have increased, there is an attendant need for enhanced results-based monitoring and evaluation of policies, programs, and projects.This Handbook provides a comprehensive ten-step model that will help guide development practitioners through the process of designing and building a results-based monitoring and evaluation system. These steps begin with a "Readiness Assessment" and take the practitioner through the design, management, and more importantly, the sustainability of such systems. Ten Steps to a Results-Based Monitoring and Evaluation System describes each step in detail, the tasks needed to complete each one, and the tools available to help along the way.}

In Experiment 1, we found that children can use probabilistic evidence to make inferences about causal strength. However, when the results of their own interventions are in conflict with the overall frequencies, preschoolers favor the results of their own interventions. In Experiment 2, children used probabilistic evidence to infer a hidden causal mechanism. Though they again gave preference to their own interventions, they did not do so when their interventions were explicitly confounded by an alternative cause.},

In addition to changes in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms over time, the study examined the predictive power of (a) different types and number of war traumata, (b) loss of social community, (c) the children's demographic characteristics (age and gender), (d) types of coping strategies and locus of control, and (e) the perceived availability of different kinds of social support. Although symptoms of posttraumatic stress declined over time, 10\% of the children reported a severe level of symptomatology 30 months after the war.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Public health interventions are complex by nature, and their evaluation requires unpacking their intervention logic and their interactions with open social systems. By focusing on the interrelationships between context, mechanism, and outcome, Pawson and Tilley's realist approach appears a promising innovation for public health-related evaluation works. However, and as expected of any methodological innovation, this approach is being constructed gradually by answering the multiple challenges to its operationalization that fall in its path. One of these challenges, users of this approach agree on, is the necessity of clarifying its key concept of mechanism.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nMETHOD: We first collected the definitions of mechanism from published works of Pawson and colleagues. Secondly, a scoping review was conducted to identify the ones quoted by users of the realist approach for evaluating public health interventions (1997-2012). We then appraised the clarity and precision of this concept against the three dimensions defined by Daigneault and Jacobs "term, sense and referent."\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nRESULTS: Of the 2344 documents identified in the scoping review, 49 documents were included. Term: Users of the realist approach use adjectives qualifying the term mechanism that were not specifically endorsed by Pawson and colleagues. Sense: None of the attributes stated by Pawson and colleagues has been listed in all of the documents analyzed, and some contributions clarified its attributes. Referent: The concept of mechanism within a realist approach can be ascribed to theory-based evaluation, complex social interventions, and critical realism.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nCONCLUSION: This review led us to reconsider the concept of mechanism within the realist approach by confronting the theoretical stance of its proponents to the practical one of its users. This resulted in a clearer, more precise definition of the concept of mechanism which may in turn trigger further improvements in the way the realist approach is applied in evaluative practice in public health and potentially beyond. A mechanism is hidden but real, is an element of reasoning and reactions of agents in regard to the resources available in a given context to bring about changes through the implementation of an intervention, and evolves within an open space-time and social system of relationships.},

  abstract = {Increasingly, thoughtful managers recognize the role of knowledge and learning in corporate action and performance. Concurrently, a new field, management and organization cognition (MOC), has emerged producing useful insights and findings. Thus far, empirical studies have largely focused on single cases or actors, using often archival data and sometimes ambiguous methods. To advance the field will require pragmatic tools for eliciting data on.thinking in real organizations and for conducting rigorous and more comparative studies of management and organization cognitions. This paper describes a method for comparatively studying real-life managerial thinking, defined here as the respective manager's beliefs about key phenomena and their efficacy links in their strategic and operative situation. The applicability of such a definition will depend on the requirements of research at hand. The payoff is that, thus defined, key elements in managerial and organizational cognitions can be usefully captured by cognitive mapping, an established approach in MOC research. The approach contains, first, a method for eliciting comparison-enabling interview data of several subjects. Then, using researcher-based, interpretive standardization of the individual natural discourses, databases of standard concepts and causal links, constituting the cause map elements, are distilled. This facilitates a text-oriented description of the thinking patterns of single actors like managers or organizational groups, which can be used in traditional-type mapping studies, which typically assume unitary or quasi-unitary actors. However, the method is intended for comparative analyses, e.g., for pinpointing the cognitive differences or similarities across organizational actors or for constructing and comparing groups, assumed cognitively homogenous. Also, it is applicable for longitudinal studies or aggregated, e.g., industry-level, descriptions of MOC. A PC application is available for the technique, although many of the processing tasks are amenable to general-purpose relational database software. The paper presents a study case comparing the cognitive structures of managers in two interrelated industries in terms. of their concept bases and causal beliefs. The objective was to understand the substance of management thinking, as well as the formative logic behind how managers come to think in the shared ways. It is shown that patterns of industry-typical core causal thinking, manifestations of a dominant logic or recipe, can be located, operationalized and comparatively analyzed with this method. Substantively, the contents of management thinking are typically products of complex long-term mechanisms. These consist, first, of organizational problem-solving, recurrently facing a specific, adequately stable constellation of strategic tasks and environment elements, similar within industries and systematically different across them, and, second, of various social processes, which directly transfer and influence management thinking. The paper concludes with discussing the cause mapping method and suggests some options for further studies.},

Here we convened, as part of this Delphi study, a diverse, multidisciplinary panel of 386 academic, health, non-governmental organization, government and other experts in COVID-19 response from 112 countries and territories to recommend specific actions to end this persistent global threat to public health. The panel developed a set of 41 consensus statements and 57 recommendations to governments, health systems, industry and other key stakeholders across six domains: communication; health systems; vaccination; prevention; treatment and care; and inequities. In the wake of nearly three years of fragmented global and national responses, it is instructive to note that three of the highest-ranked recommendations call for the adoption of whole-of-society and whole-of-government approaches1, while maintaining proven prevention measures using a vaccines-plus approach2 that employs a range of public health and financial support measures to complement vaccination. Other recommendations with at least 99\% combined agreement advise governments and other stakeholders to improve communication, rebuild public trust and engage communities3 in the management of pandemic responses. The findings of the study, which have been further endorsed by 184 organizations globally, include points of unanimous agreement, as well as six recommendations with {$>$}5\% disagreement, that provide health and social policy actions to address inadequacies in the pandemic response and help to bring this public health threat to an end.},

We first present two typologies of evaluation theory and invite readers to join us in a discussion of the pros and cons of these typologies. We then present an impressionistic picture, mainly qualitative, of how `theory' has featured in past issues of this journal. Many articles with a theoretical orientation have been published in Evaluation providing a rich though somewhat diffuse picture in which many of the types identified in our typologies are represented. Finally several suggestions are put forward to further strengthen the development of theoretical work in the evaluation profession. These are `theory knitting', `theory layering' and `theory-driven evaluation science'. Keywords},

Although most causal relations may seem straightforward, they are not always construed in the same way cross-culturally. In this study, we investigate concepts of "chance," "coincidence," or "randomness" that refer to assumed relations between intention, action, and outcome in situations, and we ask how people from different cultures make sense of such non-law-like connections. Based on a framework proposed by Alicke (2000), we administered a task that aims to be a neutral tool for investigating causal construals cross-culturally and cross-linguistically. Members of four different cultural groups, rural Mayan Yucatec and Tseltal speakers from Mexico and urban students from Mexico and Germany, were presented with a set of scenarios involving various types of causal and non-causal relations and were asked to explain the described events. Three links varied as to whether they were present or not in the scenarios: Intention-to-Action, Action-to-Outcome, and Intention-to-Outcome. Our results show that causality is recognized in all four cultural groups. However, how causality and especially non-law-like relations are interpreted depends on the type of links, the cultural background and the language used. In all three groups, Action-to-Outcome is the decisive link for recognizing causality. Despite the fact that the two Mayan groups share similar cultural backgrounds, they display different ideologies regarding concepts of non-law-like relations. The data suggests that the concept of "chance" is not universal, but seems to be an explanation that only some cultural groups draw on to make sense of specific situations. Of particular importance is the existence of linguistic concepts in each language that trigger ideas of causality in the responses from each cultural group.}

The development of fair and equitable corporate sustainability reporting (CSR) initiatives requires that these temporal aspects be properly taken into account. In order to relate indicators of environmental pressure to indicators of environmental state changes, time scales specific to that pressure should be used. We review the different ways in which temporal aspects have been dealt with in CSR and other reporting schemes and show that there is often no consistent and rigorous treatment of time. We discuss several obstacles that may have impeded the appropriate treatment of time in CSR so far and suggest that these issues must be resolved as CSR becomes more widely adopted.}

Based on a review of East-West cultural differences in dialectical emotions, or co-occurring positive and negative feelings, we predicted culture to influence the association between positive emotions and depression, but not the association between negative emotions and depression. As predicted, in a survey of over 600 European-, immigrant Asian-, and Asian American college students, positive emotions were associated with depression symptoms among European Americans and Asian Americans, but not immigrant Asians. Negative emotions were associated with depression symptoms among all three groups. We also found initial evidence that acculturation (i.e., nativity) may influence the role of positive emotions in depression: Asian Americans fell ``in between'' the two other groups. These findings suggest the importance of studying the role of culture in positive emotions and in positive psychology. The use of interventions based on promoting positive emotions in clinical psychology among Asian clients is briefly discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2011 APA, all rights reserved)},

The examination of more than 45 quantitative and qualitative studies finds that relationships with older partners and those that involve economic transactions are common and that these asymmetries are associated with unsafe sexual behaviors and increased risk of HIV infection. Although the reasons that adolescent girls engage in sexual relationships with older men are varied, receipt of financial benefits is a major motivation. The literature presents evidence that girls have considerable negotiating power over certain aspects of sexual relationships with older men, including partnership formation and continuation; however, they have little control over sexual practices within partnerships, including condom use and violence. The review discusses directions for further research and the implications of current knowledge for future interventions.},

Moreover, the trophic coherence of a network, defined in terms of trophic levels, is related to properties such as cycle structure, stability and percolation. The standard definition of trophic levels, however, borrowed from ecology, suffers from drawbacks such as requiring source nodes, which limit its applicability. Here we propose a simple new definition of trophic level that can be computed on any directed network. We demonstrate how the method can identify node function in examples including ecosystems, supply chain networks, gene expression, and global language networks. We also explore how trophic levels and coherence relate to other topological properties, such as non-normality and cycle structure, and show that our method reveals the extent to which the edges in a directed network are aligned in a global direction.},

Using this approach, we first consider four kinds of counterfactuals: necessary condition counterfactuals, SUIN condition counterfactuals, sufficient condition counterfactuals, and INUS condition counterfactuals. We explore the distinctive causal claims entailed in each, and conclude that necessary condition and SUIN condition counterfactuals are the most useful types for hypothesis assessment in case-study research. We then turn attention to the development of a rigorous understanding of the 'minimal-rewrite' rule, linking this rule to insights from set theory about the relative importance of necessary conditions. We show why, logically speaking, a comparative analysis of two necessary condition counterfactuals will tend to favour small events and contingent happenings. A third section then presents new tools for specifying the level of generality of the events in a counterfactual. We show why and how the goals of formulating empirically important versus empirically plausible counterfactuals stand in tension with one another. Finally, we use our framework to link counterfactual analysis to causal sequences, which in turn provides advantages for conducting counterfactual projections.},

With respect to mechanisms, I argue that the core of process tracing with causal inference is the identification of mechanisms understood as intervening events. Events are different from standard intervening variables when used with process tracing, because events are treated as sets in which cases can have membership. With respect to Bayesian analysis, I concur with recent writings that suggest Bayesian inference is at the heart of process tracing. The Bayesian nature of process tracing explains why it is inappropriate to view qualitative research as suffering from a small-N problem and certain standard causal identification problems. More generally, the paper shows how the power of process tracing as a qualitative methodology depends on and grows from its set-theoretic underpinnings.}

Although it is widely recognized that the selection of negative cases is consequential for theory testing, methodologists have yet to formulate specific rules to inform this selection process. In this paper, we propose a principle-the Possibility Principle-that provides explicit, rigorous, and theoretically informed guidelines for choosing a set of negative cases. The Possibility Principle advises researchers to select only negative cases where the outcome of interest is possible. Our discussion elaborates this principle and its implications for current debates about case selection and strategies of theory testing. Major points are illustrated with substantive examples from studies of revolution, economic growth, welfare states, and war.

  abstract = {The concept of social stratification and hierarchy among human dates is back to the origin of human race. Presently, the growing reputation of social networks has given us with an opportunity to analyze these well-studied phenomena over different networks at different scales. Generally, a social network could be defined as a collection of actors and their interactions. In this work, we concern ourselves with a particular type of social networks, known as trust networks. In this type of networks, there is an explicit show of trust (positive interaction) or distrust (negative interaction) among the actors. In a social network, actors tend to connect with each other on the basis of their perceived social hierarchy. The emergence of such a hierarchy within a social community shows the manner in which authority manifests in the community. In the case of signed networks, the concept of social hierarchy can be interpreted as the emergence of a tree-like structure comprising of actors in a top-down fashion in the order of their ranks, describing a specific parent-child relationship, viz. child trusts parent. However, owing to the presence of positive as well as negative interactions in signed networks, deriving such ``trust hierarchies'' is a non-trivial challenge. We argue that traditional notions (of unsigned networks) are insufficient to derive hierarchies that are latent within signed networks.}

(Markiczy and Goldberg, 1995, p. 1) Introduce a replicable elicitation technique, develop a way of comparing maps and a propose a distance measure between comparable maps which is an improvement on langfield-smith \& Wirth's measure. Links have three positive and three negative levels of strength. Specify a relatively structured method for eliciting individual maps from each respondent, in which the respondent is shown pairs of common factors and asked if they influence one another. Discuss also the problem of the ``non-presence'' of a factor and/or a link: what can we infer from the fact that one respondent happened not to mention it?

  abstract = {In 1987, the authors of Our common future argued that unless the world embraced and operationalized sustainable development, it would risk being overwhelmed by a series of interlocking crises related to population growth, urbanization, poverty and environmental degradation. Since then, many authors have argued that the world is on a worst case scenario trajectory. Post-Rio assessments of progress towards sustainable development have been largely negative. Since 1987, climate change has added a new stressor to the mix while shortening the time frame for transformation. In the context of accelerating change and converging stresses is the concept of sustainable development as compelling today as it was twenty years ago? Is it reasonable to believe there are means by which to reduce poverty and simultaneously protect the environment? This article briefly reviews the global challenges that first stimulated the concept of sustainable development and asks how contemporary processes of global change are affecting both these challenges and this approach to addressing them. While there are some grounds for optimism, several variables are identified that make sustainable development increasingly difficult to design and implement. The article concludes with an evaluation of how these difficulties might be overcome, and why it is essential that we try. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

"I will
first outline the positivist/empiricist and constructivist positions on
qualitative research and causal explanation and then describe a realist
approach that avoids many of the problems created by these positions. The
positivist/empiricist position regarding research on causality is that
qualitative research methods cannot by themselves be used to establish
causalrelationshipsorcausalexplanations.Thenarrowversionofthisposition, as
stated by Light, Singer, and Willett (1990), is that "to establish a
causallink,youmustconductanexperiment." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SY4VZLFZ?page=2}{Maxwell

"Hempel later added models of statistical explanation
to this (Salmon 1989:1-25). This "regularity" theory, with modifications,
has been the dominant causal theory in quantitative research in the social
sciences (Mohr 1996:9" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SY4VZLFZ?page=3}{Maxwell

position by denying that causality is a valid concept in the social
sciences" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SY4VZLFZ?page=3}{Maxwell

"Until recently, the dominant view was that field
studies should busy themselves with description and leave the explanations
to people with large quantitative data bases. Or perhaps field
researchers, as is now widely believed, can provide "exploratory"
explanations\textemdash which still need to be quantitatively verified. Much recent
research supports a claim that we wish to make here: that field research
is far better than solely quantified approaches at developing explanations
of what we call local causality\textemdash the actual events and processes that led
to specific outcomes (Miles and Huberman 1984:132, emphasis in original"

justification must accomplish. First, it must establish the philosophical
credibility of this position" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SY4VZLFZ?page=5}{Maxwell

\par
"Second, it must address the practical methodological
issue" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SY4VZLFZ?page=5}{Maxwell
2004:247})
\par
"Second, in seeing context as intrinsically involved
in causal processes, it supports the insistence of qualitative researchers
on the explanatory importance of context and does so in a way that does
not simply reduce this context to a set of "extraneous variables" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SY4VZLFZ?page=6}{Maxwell

"Realism is also compatible with many other features
of constructivism and postmodernism (Baert 1998:174; Maxwell, 1995, 1999,
2004b), including the idea that difference is fundamental rather than
superficial, a skepticism toward "general laws," antifoundationalism, and
a relativist epistemology. Where it differs from these is primarily in its
realist ontology\textemdash a commitment to the existence of a real, although not
"objectively" knowable, world\textemdash and its emphasis on causality (although a
fundamentally different concept of causality than that of the positivists)
as intrinsic to social science" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SY4VZLFZ?page=6}{Maxwell

of patient falls in a hospital (Morse and Tylko 1985; Morse, Tylko, and
Dixon 1987) that included qualitative observations of, and interviews
with, elderly patients who had fallen, focusing on how they moved around
in the hospital environment and the reasons they fell. The researchers
used these data to identify causes of falls, such as the use of furniture
or IV poles for support, that had not been reported in previous
quantitative studies. This identification was made possible by the study's
focus on the process of patient ambulation and the specific events and

  abstract = {Theories of change are increasingly being discussed and referenced in development evaluation even while the elements of what a theory of change consist of differ widely among applications. Equally, examples of actual use of theories of change other than as overview illustrations of interventions are rare. In this article, we present generic models of theories of change for both straightforward and more complex interventions. A number of examples of evidence-based theories of change in the area of agriculture research for nutrition and health are discussed, as is the need for different versions of a theory of change for different purposes. We also discuss the use and analysis of these models in the planning, managing and assessing of research-related interventions, illustrating the practical usefulness of well-developed theories of change.},

The volumes of this two-volume set of books cover issues pertaining to trauma psychology. Whether the traumatic stressor is violence, disaster, or illness or some other form of trauma the variable "social support" comes through as a key factor in resilience during the trauma and quick recovery after the trauma. While the volumes cover certain specific events like the 2001 World Trade Center attack, the 2004 Madrid terrorist attack, and the tsunami disaster in the Indian Ocean in 2004, the emphasis is not on characteristics of the stressors but rather on those aspects of intervention and prevention that can reduce the overall devastating effects of traumatic events. Readers of both volumes cannot fail to notice that regardless of the type of stressor, traumatic sequelae bear many similarities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved)},

The article also investigates whether the nature of the interactions with others moderates the personality-performance relations. The meta-analysis was based on 11 studies (total N = 1,586). each of which assessed the FFM at the construct level using the Personal Characteristics Inventory. Results support the hypothesis that Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, and Emotional Stability are positively related to performance in jobs involving interpersonal interactions. Results also support the hypothesis that Emotional Stability and Agreeableness are more strongly related to performance in jobs that involve team- work (where employees interact interdependently with coworkers), than in those that involve dyadic interactions with others (where employees provide a direct service to customers and clients). Implications for developing theories of work performance and for selecting employees are discussed.}

Three theories are identified: the representational, the operational, and the classical. In each case the relation between measurement scales and statistical procedures is explored. The representational theory implies a relation between measurement scales and statistics, though not the one mentioned by Stevens or his followers. The operational and classical theories, for different reasons, imply no relation between measurement scales and statistics, contradicting Stevens's prescriptions. A resolution of this issue depends on a critical evaluation of these different theories.},

In proposing quantitative theories and claiming to measure the attributes involved, psychologists are logically committed to both tasks. However, they have adopted their own, special, definition of measurement, one that deflects attention away from the scientific task. It is argued that this is not accidental. From Fechner onwards, the dominant tradition in quantitative psychology ignored this task. Stevens' definition rationalized this neglect. The widespread acceptance of this definition within psychology made this neglect systemic, with the consequence that the implications of contemporary research in measurement theory for undertaking the scientific task are not appreciated. It is argued further that when the ideological support structures of a science sustain serious blind spots like this, then that science is in the grip of some kind of thought disorder. \textbackslash ldotsunluckily our professors of psychology in general are not up to quantitative logic\textbackslash ldots E.

  abstract = {Human communication is invariably executed in the form of a narrative, an account of connected events comprising characters, actions, and settings. A coherent and well-structured narrative is therefore essential for effective communication, confusion caused by a haphazard attempt at storytelling being a common experience. This also suggests that a scientific understanding of how a narrative is formed and delivered is key to understanding human communication and dialog. Here we show that the definition of a narrative lends itself naturally to network-based modeling and analysis, and they can be further enriched by incorporating various text analysis methods from computational linguistics. We model the temporally unfolding nature of narrative as a dynamical growing network of nodes and edges representing characters and interactions, which allows us to characterize the story progression using the network growth pattern. We also introduce the concept of an interaction map between characters based on associated sentiments and topics identified from the text that characterize their relationships explicitly. We demonstrate the methods via application to Victor Hugo's Les Mis\'erables. Going beyond simple, aggregate occurrence-based methods for narrative representation and analysis, our proposed methods show promise in uncovering its essential nature of a highly complex, dynamic system that reflects the rich structure of human interaction and communication.},

Mental models research offers a suite of methods that can be used to reveal these understandings and how they might affect conservation outcomes. Mental models are representations in people's minds of how parts of the world work. We seek to demonstrate their value to conservation and assist practitioners and researchers in navigating the choices of methods available to elicit them. We begin by explaining some of the dominant applications of mental models in conservation: revealing individual assumptions about a system, developing a stakeholder-based model of the system, and creating a shared pathway to conservation. We then provide a framework to ``walk through'' the stepwise decisions in mental models research, with a focus on diagram-based methods. Finally, we discuss some of the limitations of mental models research and application that are important to consider. This work extends the use of mental models research in improving our ability to understand social-ecological systems, creating a powerful set of tools to inform and shape conservation initiatives.},

  abstract = {Process evaluation is an essential part of designing and testing complex interventions. New MRC guidance provides a framework for conducting and reporting process evaluation studies Attempts to tackle problems such as smoking and obe-sity increasingly use complex interventions. These are commonly defined as interventions that comprise mul-tiple interacting components, although additional dimensions of complexity include the difficulty of their implementation and the number of organisational lev-els they target. 1 Randomised controlled trials are regarded as the gold standard for establishing the effectiveness of interventions, when randomisation is feasible. However, effect sizes do not provide policy makers with information on how an intervention might be replicated in their specific context, or whether trial outcomes will be reproduced. Earlier MRC guidance for evaluating complex interventions focused on ran-domised trials, making no mention of process evalua-tion. 2 Updated guidance recognised the value of process evaluation within trials, stating that it " can be used to assess fidelity and quality of implementation, clarify causal mechanisms and identify contextual fac-tors associated with variation in outcomes. " 3 However, it did not provide guidance for carrying out process evaluation. Developing guidance for process evaluation In 2010, a workshop funded by the MRC Population Health Science Research Network discussed the need for guidance on process evaluation. 4 There was consen-sus that researchers, funders, and reviewers would ben-efit from guidance. A group of researchers with experience and expertise in evaluating complex inter-ventions was assembled to produce the guidance. In line with the principles followed in developing earlier MRC guidance documents, draft guidance was pro-duced drawing on literature reviews, process evalua-tion case studies, workshops, and discussions at conferences and seminars. It was then circulated to aca-demic, policy, and practice stakeholders for comment. Around 30 stakeholders provided written comments on the draft structure, while others commented during conference workshops run throughout the development process. A full draft was recirculated for further review, before being revised and approved by key MRC funding panels. Although the aim was to provide guidance on pro-cess evaluation of public health interventions, the guidance is highly relevant to complex intervention research in other domains, such as health services and education. The full guidance (www.populationhealth-sciences.org/Process-Evaluation-Guidance.html) begins by setting out the need for process evaluation. It then presents a review of influential theories and frameworks which informed its development, before offering practical recommendations, and six detailed case studies. In this article, we provide an overview of the new framework and summarise our practical recommendations using one of the case studies as an example. MRC process evaluation framework The new framework builds on the process evaluation themes described in the 2008 MRC complex interven-tions guidance (fig 1). 3 Although the role of theory within evaluation is contested, 5 6 we concur with the position set out in the 2008 guidance, which argued that an understanding of the causal assumptions underpinning the intervention and use of evaluation to understand how interventions work in practice are vital in building an evidence base that informs policy and practice. 1 Causal assumptions may be drawn from social science theory, although complex interventions will often also be informed by other factors such as past experience or common sense. An intervention as simple as a health information leaflet, for example, may reflect an assumption that increased knowledge of health consequences will trigger behavioural change. Explicitly stating causal assumptions about how the intervention will work can allow external scrutiny of its plausibility and help evaluators decide which aspects of the intervention or its context to prioritise for inves-tigation. Our framework also emphasises the relations between implementation, mechanisms, and context. For example, implementation of a new intervention will be},

In this paper ideas of what constitutes evidence was open to discussion
with practitioners involved in each synthesis process. Research evidence

investigation, seen as appropriate and relevant by both researchers and
practitioners, and that met the quality criteria, were included in the
term 'evidence'. Synthesising evidence for policy and practice Our
experience of working with third and public sector organisations at the
time highlighted lack of relevant, focused and robust reviews of
literature which responded to their needs. Limitations of current methods
for synthesising research were also apparent in the literature, for
example the inability of the 'standard' Cochrane Collaboration type
systematic review to accommodate variations in study design and
acknowledge different types of research (Boaz et al, 2006). The value of
qualitative evidence to inform policy and practice is increasingly
recognised and methods for reviewing qualitative research in systematic
ways are 8emerging (Thomas and Harden, 2008; Ring et al, 2011). Yet
methods such as thematic 3synthesis (see Thomas and Harden, 2008) and
realist synthesis (Pawson et al, 2005) 1require significant time and

However, assessing the impact of social science research on policy and practice is challenging. The ways in which research is taken up, used, and reused in policy and practice settings means that linking research processes or outputs to wider changes is difficult, and timescales are hard to predict. This article proposes an empirically grounded framework for assessing the impact of research\textemdash the Research Contribution Framework. A case study approach was adopted to explore the nature of research impact and how it might be assessed. Findings were used to design, develop, and test a framework to assess the contribution of research to relevant areas of policy and practice and to articulate wider benefits. The framework has been adapted from contribution analysis, using the idea of `contribution' to help explain the ways research is taken up and used to influence policy and practice. The framework allows for a focus on the roles of research users, and examines both processes and outcomes. It is argued that this approach gets round some of the common problems in assessing impact. It provides a method of linking research and knowledge exchange to wider outcomes whilst acknowledging and including contextual factors that help or hinder research impact. It is practical, balancing robustness with feasibility. It is adaptable for a wide range of content, types of impact assessment, and purposes.},

can be examined and tracked back to research. Specific interventions such

A review of 117 studies (published 1952-1988) yielded 162 samples totaling 23,994 Ss. Conscientiousness showed consistent relations with all job performance criteria for all occupational groups. Extraversion was a valid predictor for 2 occupations involving social interaction, (managers and sales). Also, openness to experience and extraversion were valid predictors of the training proficiency criterion across occupations.

Although TBCMs have been used extensively in organizational behavior and strategic management research, studies assessing the psychometric properties of TBCM measures are virtually nonexistent. With the intention of facilitating large-sample substantive research using TBCMs, the authors examine the construct validity of two most frequently employed structural properties of TBCMs: complexity and centrality. In assessing construct validity, they examine the internal consistency, dimensionality, and predictive validity of the structural properties. The results suggest that complexity is not a general cognitive attribute. Rather, it is indicative of domain knowledge. On the other hand, centrality, which reflects the degree of hierarchy characterizing the TBCM, is related to cognitive ability and may reflect general information processing. Moreover, complexity and centrality, but not cognitive ability, predicted student performance.},

  abstract = {Abstract In this chapter, / provide an historical overview of the use of causal mapping, and its migration from political science to organization theory, and more recently into research efforts in Information Technology (IT). Since this migration has brought in its wake a diversity of perspectives and approaches, a secondary objective of this chapter is to sketch this diversity. I discuss the diversity in perspectives, research contexts and focus. Three perspectives (social constructionist, objectivist, and expert- anchored), four research contexts (discovery, hypothesis testing, evocative and intervention) and three types offoci (content, structure and behavior) are summarized. Introduction A remarkable revolution is underway in the organization sciences: A new generation of scholars is enthusiastically bringing the role of the human mind back into the study of organizations. Unlike the deterministic views of man expounded by Skinner or of organizations promulgated by the early contingency theorists such as Lawrence and Lorsch, this new breed of scholars takes inspiration from the works of Barnard, Simon and Weick, and pays serious attention to human cognitive processes. Their cognitive agenda is enabled by the availability ofnew research tools that have made possible the study Of thought using "normal science" approaches. Indeed, these new tools have reached a level Of maturity as witnessed by their increasingly frequent use in papers published in major management journals ( Narayanan \& Kemmerer, 2001 One ofthese tools that has great potential for advancing research in managerial cognition is causal mapping. Causal maps represent thought as a network of causal relations, representing concepts through nodes and causality though links between nodes. They invoke the notion of causation, and users of the tool observe that causal analysis is built into our natural language, while side-stepping the philosophical challenges associated with the notion ofcausality. In recent years, this tool has been considered one of the most effective ways of representing thought (Mohammed, Klimoski \& Rentsch, 2001). This book is devoted exclusively to causal mapping. The primary objective ofthis chapter is to provide an historical overview of the use of causal mapping, and its migration from political science to organization theory, and more recently into research efforts in IT. This migration has brought in its wake a diversity of perspectives and approaches, and therefore, a secondary objective of this chapter is to sketch this diversity, so that readers can appreciate the subtle differences among the various users of the tool. Thus, this chapter is meant for those interested in an appreciation of the technique beyond its immediate application. This chapter unfolds in two major sections. In the first section, I detail the migration of the causal mapping technique over five stages, identifying the milestones in its evolu- tion, and the seminal works that punctuate this evolution. In the second, I summarize the diversity Of approaches among users Of causal mapping and, indeed, the discerning reader will notice this diversity in the contributions Of this edited book. Evolution of Causal Mapping The term cognitive maps appeared in a paper written by Edward C. Tolman titled, "Cognitive Maps in Rats and Men," in the Psychological Review in 1948. Although he did not use the term in the sense known in organization sciences, Tolman extolled the virtues of reason, which were in contrast to the behavioral psychologist's view which focused on stimulus response mechanisms for explaining human behavior. The term was later used by Axelrod to name the methods he and his colleagues employed to represent the arguments ofpolitical elites. The term, "cognitive maps," however, conveyed the idea that the maps represented the actual workings of the mind. TO avoid the claim that they were representing thought scholars following Axelrod began to employ the term "causal mapping." These scholars claimed that they focused only on causal assertions in a specific set of texts. In addition to the evolution Of the terminology, several streams Of scholarship have contributed to the initial use ofcausal mapping as a tool for representing thought. These streams are varied and Often not related to each other. Nonetheless, it is useful to reflect on this rich heritage, if only to discover opportunities that have not yet been exploited in the contemporary applications Of this tool. I discuss this evolution in five sections: (1 ) EQly Precursors; (2) Immediate Precursors; (3) Axelrod's Seminal Work; (4) Causal Mapping in Organizational Sciences; and (5) Causal Mapping in IS. This is schematically presented in Figure l. Early Precursors By early precursors, I refer to the streams of thought that are closely related to causal mapping, although they may not have been the sources of the original formulation of the tooL Although it is almost impossible to sketch all [H)ssible precursors, at least two distinct streams of thought have close affinity to the original causal mapping technique: structure of arguments, and industrial dynamics. Structure of arguments. The idea that arguments can be represented has been well established in the philosophy of science for a quite a long time. A specific example was provided by Toulmin ( 1958): His analysis scheme is complex as it embraced a broader set of foci than the ones we find in contemporary causal mapping. The scheme responded directly to the need for a methodology that systematically probes the content, logic, and reasonableness of an argument, irrespective of the discipline or context and intent of the argument. The Toulmin framework was intended to achieve three purposes: l) 2) 3) to enable the elements (and thus the structure) Of any "argument" to be captured and delineated; to allow any individual (whether the argument purveyor, opponent, or interested third party) to assess the quality of reasoning at the heart of the argument; and to facilitate the comparison and assessment of two or more arguments, that is, to identify differences among arguments and to determine what these differences mean to both the reasoning and the outcomes.},

  abstract = {This article integrates the literature on strategic cognition (SC) within a framework that links the antecedents, structure, and process of SC with outcomes. Reviewing the literature from 1993 (two years prior to Walsh's review of managerial and organizational cognition) until 2007, this article identifies three elements of SC structure (organizational identity, strategy frames, and organizational routines) and four SC processes (strategy formulation, strategy implementation, strategic change, and organizational learning). The literature portrays strategy formulation as a complex activity consisting of scanning, sensemaking, and decision making. Strategy implementation is composed of sensegiving, sensemaking, and issue selling. This review identifies five streams of empirical research with three well-developed themes (the antecedents and outcomes of strategy frames, determinants and consequences of strategy formulation, and cognitive construction of competitive/industry dynamics) and two emerging themes (the determinants and consequences of strategy implementation and the antecedents and outcomes of organizational identity). This review identifies several opportunities to extend the literature and outlines key methodological implications. Finally, the review addresses the need to build linkages to the ongoing theoretical conversations within strategic management literature. \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2011.},

The prevalence rate of tsunami-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (ignoring the time criterion) ranged between 14\% and 39\% and an additional 5\% to 8\% had PTSD unrelated to the tsunami. The PTSD symptoms were explained by the severity of the trauma exposure and family loss, as well as previous traumatic events. The results confirm the relevance of the individual history of traumatic events for the genesis of PTSD and indicate a high need of mental health assistance among the tsunami-affected children in Sri Lanka.},

While digital data collection facilitates faster and more reliable analysis, existing data collection tools are not optimized for unstructured qualitative (textual) data and peer-to-peer participant collaboration. In this paper, we propose a system called the Development Collaborative Assessment and Feedback Engine version 1.0 (DevCAFE), a customizable participatory assessment platform that collects and integrates quantitative assessment, qualitative feedback and peer-to-peer collaborative filtering. DevCAFE incorporates a library of statistical analyses for researchers to quickly identify quantitative and qualitative trends while collecting field data. DevCAFE can run on any mobile device with a web-browser and can work with or without Internet connectivity. We present results from two pilot projects: (1) 137 participants evaluating family planning education trainings at three Nutrition Education Centers in rural Uganda, and (2) 4,518 participants evaluating policy priorities for elected leaders in the June 2015 Mexico mid-term elections. DevCAFE collected over 19,000 peer-to-peer ratings of 336 submitted ideas. Feedback gathered through DevCAFE enabled targeted reforms to the family planning efforts in Uganda and the need for increased government attention to public safety in Mexico.

  abstract = {We introduce Explanatory Learning (EL), a framework to let machines use existing knowledge buried in symbolic sequences \textendash{} e.g. explanations written in hieroglyphic \textendash{} by autonomously learning to interpret them. In EL, the burden of interpreting symbols is not left to humans or rigid human-coded compilers, as done in Program Synthesis. Rather, EL calls for a learned interpreter, built upon a limited collection of symbolic sequences paired with observations of several phenomena. This interpreter can be used to make predictions on a novel phenomenon given its explanation, and even to find that explanation using only a handful of observations, like human scientists do. We formulate the EL problem as a simple binary classification task, so that common end-to-end approaches aligned with the dominant empiricist view of machine learning could, in principle, solve it. To these models, we oppose Critical Rationalist Networks (CRNs), which instead embrace a rationalist view on the acquisition of knowledge. CRNs express several desired properties by construction, they are truly explainable, can adjust their processing at test-time for harder inferences, and can offer strong confidence guarantees on their predictions. As a final contribution, we introduce Odeen, a basic EL environment that simulates a small flatland-style universe full of phenomena to explain. Using Odeen as a testbed, we show how CRNs outperform empiricist end-to-end approaches of similar size and architecture (Transformers) in discovering explanations for novel phenomena.},

(Johnson et al., 2017) posed a communication problem in a universe of

example is CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), where 400,000,000 captioned
internet images are arranged in a communication problem to train an

needed to solve the task is embedded in the data, ignoring the
explanations; we may call it a "radical empiricist" approach (Pearl,
2021). A variant that includes the explanations in the pipeline can be
done by adding a textual head to the network. This way, we expect
performance to improve because predicting the explanation string can aid
the classification task. As we show in the experiments, the latter
approach (called "conscious empiricist") indeed improves upon the former;
yet, it treats the explanations as mere data, nothing more than mute
strings to match, in a Chinese room fashion (Searle, 1980; Bender \&

Drawing upon literatures in several disciplines, we present a theory of
resilience that encompasses contemporary understandings of stress,
adaptation, wellness, and resource dynamics. Community resilience is a
process linking a network of adaptive capacities (resources with dynamic
attributes) to adaptation after a disturbance or adversity. Community
adaptation is manifest in population wellness, defined as high and

Community resilience is a process linking a network of adaptive capacities (resources with dynamic attributes) to adaptation after a disturbance or adversity. Community adaptation is manifest in population wellness, defined as high and non-disparate levels of mental and behavioral health, functioning, and quality of life.

The reports were examined to find evidence of five key elements of evaluative reasoning, namely, evaluative objectives or questions, criteria or other comparator(s), defined standards, a warranted argument, and an evaluative conclusion or judgement. Only eight of the evaluation reports had evidence of all five ele- ments. While the focus of the meta-evaluation was on the presence of the five elements (not their quality) and the report sample is not representative, the study provides an interesting snapshot of evalu- ative practice in Aotearoa New Zealand.

Thus, the authors provide a new qualitative framework for collecting and analyzing focus group data. First, they identify types of data that can be collected during focus groups. Second, they identify the qualitative data analysis techniques best suited for analyzing these data. Third, they introduce what they term as a micro-interlocutor analysis, wherein meticulous information about which participant responds to each question, the order in which each participant responds, response characteristics, the nonverbal communication used, and the like is collected, analyzed, and interpreted. They conceptualize how conversation analysis offers great potential for analyzing focus group data. They believe that their framework goes far beyond analyzing only the verbal communication of focus group participants, thereby increasing the rigor of focus group analyses in social science research.},

  abstract = {The passage of the Contract with America Advancement Act terminated the Social Security Administration's Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income benefits for persons diagnosed with drug or alcohol addiction (also known as DA\&A recipients), effective January 1, 1997. From an evaluation standpoint, the law created the opportunity for a ``natural'' experiment, specifically, an interrupted time series quasi-experiment. Through the availability of person-level data on an entire state population, the present study combines the design tradition of interrupted time series with the analytic tradition of growth curve modeling to create an ``enriched'' interrupted time series with greater flexibility and explanatory power than the standard design based on aggregate data. Additional techniques from the contemporary evaluation toolkit include: use of propensity scoring for matching and covariance adjustment, multilevel modeling, alternate estimates of the counter-factual, and sensitivity analyses to empirically test the plausibility of validity threats. The study assesses the net impact of the law on labor force participation and criminal behavior among former DA\&A recipients in Washington State, using person-level data on employment and arrests from 2 years before implementation to 3 years after. Hypothesis tests showed unambiguously that the law increased employment but did not increase arrests. Post hoc exploratory analyses\textemdash framed by Mark et al. [Mark, M. M., Henry, G. T., \& Julnes, G. (2000). Evaluation: An integrated framework for understanding, guiding, and improving policies and programs.

The combination of a priori and post hoc analyses confirmed that, as a result of the law, there were fewer DA\&As on public supports, more DA\&As in the workforce, and no evidence of more criminals menacing the public. Analyses also confirmed that a segment of the population, already poor, was made destitute.}

  abstract = {Qualitative comparative analysis was initially time-agnostic, but efforts to make the method more time-sensitive have been made since the mid-2000s. These attempts mainly focus on cross-case differences, accounting for change over time at the level of attributes or conditions. While useful, they cannot account for the fact that individual cases also develop over time. As such, strategies regarding `within-case' development have remained under-theorized in qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). To address this gap, we propose trajectory-based qualitative comparative analysis (TJ-QCA) building on the logic of the diversity-oriented approach: meaningful within-case change is carefully defined in terms of development stages that capture qualitative case-based change patterns. We conceptualize configurations dynamically so that they express different development stages. Theoretically, our method is rooted in a complexity-informed understanding of cases describing trajectories through the property space. Trajectory-based qualitative comparative analysis works with both numerical and qualitative data. We will illustrate the method empirically by re-elaborating a well-known published time-sensitive qualitative comparative analysis study.}

The method identifies clusters of outcomes, both expected and unexpected, happening within areas of change. In a workshop, change agents describe the causal connections within outcome clusters to identify outcome trajectories for subsequent verification. Comparing verified outcome trajectories with existing program theory allows program staff to question underlying causal premises and adapt accordingly. The method can be used for one-off evaluations that seek to understand whether, how, and why program interventions are working. Repeated cycles of outcome evidencing can build a case for program contribution over time that can be evaluated as part of any future impact assessment of the program or parts of it. Many programs that set out to make a difference to people's lives are increasingly being understood as complex interventions in complex systems (Pawson, 2013). Complexity science provides a range of insights into how change happens, including the idea of emergence and positive feedback loops. Taking these insights onboard means program staff must necessarily grapple with uncertainty as to the nature, size, and pathways to intended program impact (Douthwaite, Kuby, van de Fliert, \& Schulz, 2003; Patton, 2011), which can be problematic when donors require reassurance about the likely returns on their investments. This is particularly so for agricultural research for development programs, which are adaptive research programs in which researchers are expected to specify and implement according to program theory linking their research to uptake and impact (},

Though it is basic to human thought, causality is a notion shrouded in mystery, con-troversy, and caution, because scientists and philosophers have had difficulties defining when one event truly causes another. We all understand that the rooster's crow does not cause the sun to rise, but even this simple fact cannot easily be translated into a mathematical equation. Today, I would like to share with you a set of ideas which I have found very useful in studying phenomena of this kind. These ideas have led to practical tools that I hope you will find useful on your next encounter with cause and effect. It is hard to imagine anyone here who is not dealing with cause and effect. Whether you are evaluating the impact of bilin-gual education programs or running an experiment on how mice distinguish food from danger or spec-ulating about why Julius Caesar crossed the Rubi-con or diagnosing a patient or predicting who will win the presidential election, you are dealing with a tangled web of cause\textendash effect considerations. The story that I am about to tell is aimed at helping researchers deal with the complexities of such considerations, and to clarify their meaning. This lecture is divided into three parts. I begin with a brief historical sketch of the difficulties that various disciplines have had with causation. Next I outline the ideas that reduce or elimi-nate several of these historical difficulties.},

  year = {2019},
  pages = {1--4},
  abstract = {Participatory Systems Mapping is a participatory modelling methodology in which a group of stakeholders collaboratively develop a simple causal map of an issue during the course of a workshop. Stakeholders produce a map made up of factors, which can represent anything as along as they are expressed as a variable (i.e. can in some sense go up and down) and connections which represent causal relationships. The map is intended to represent what stakeholders believe to be the causal structure of their system. The map can be built using a white-board or simple pen and paper materials on a large table. The process of building a map can be hugely valuable to participants, the digitized version of the map can be a useful resource, and additional analysis can be conducted on the map created. Why use Participatory Systems Mapping? These types of models provide thinking tools which can be used for discussion and exploration of complex issues, as well as sense checking the implications of suggested causal links. Such "hands on" complexity science can increase stakeholder motivation and understanding of the scope of whole systems approaches. The diagram above is an example map. We can see the factors in the system represented by the rectangles, and the connections between them by arrows denoting the strength, direction, and nature (positive or negative) of the casual influence. The following eleven steps give a detailed breakdown of how to generate your own Participatory Systems Map (PSM). They are written so that you can use pen, paper, and post-it notes. 11 Steps in creating Participatory Systems Maps in a workshop setting: 1. Pick a focal problem 2. Gather knowledge 3. Pick a focal factor 4. Brainstorm factors 5. Consolidate factors 6. Connecting factors 7. Check the connections 8. Collect factor \& link info 9. Map analysis 10. Verification 11. Scenarios},

  abstract = {Background: Given the unprecedented number of traumatized refugee minors in Europe and the increased prevalence of mental disorders such as PTSD in this vulnerable population, new methodologies that help us to better understand their symptomatology are crucial. Network analysis might help clinicians to both understand which symptoms might trigger other symptoms, and to identify relevant targets for treatment. However, to date only two studies have applied the network analysis approach to an (adult) refugee population and only three studies examined this approach in children and adolescents. Objective: The aim of this study is to explore the network structure and centrality of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms in a cross-sectional sample of severely traumatized refugee minors. Method: A total of N = 419 (Mage = 16.3; 90.7\% male) unaccompanied (79.9\%) and accompanied (20.1\%) refugee minors were recruited in five studies in southern Germany. PTSD symptoms were assessed using the Child and Adolescent Trauma Screen (CATS). The network was estimated using state-of-the-art regularized partial correlation models using the R-package qgraph. Results: The most central symptoms were nightmares, physiological and psychological reactivity, and concentration problems. The strongest connections between symptoms were established for psychological and physiological reactivity, irritability/anger and selfdestructive/reckless behaviour, intrusions and nightmares, nightmares and sleep disturbance, and between concentrations problems and sleep disturbance. Conclusion: This study furnishes information relevant to research and the clinical management of PTSD in refugee minors, and also in terms of comparisons with trauma-exposed children and adolescents without a migration background. Re-experiencing symptoms seem to be central in the refugee minor PTSD profile and thus merit special consideration in the diagnostic and treatment evaluation process. Investigating the PTSD network longitudinally and complementing between-subject analyses with within-subject ones might provide further insight into the symptomatology of refugee minors and how to treat them successfully.},

Network graphs are created from codes applied to a transcript or audio file using the code names and their chronological location. The resulting network is a representation of the coding data that characterizes the interrelations of codes. This approach enables quantification of qualitative codes using network analysis and facilitates examination of associations of network indices with other quantitative variables using common statistical procedures. Here, as a proof of concept, we applied this method to a set of interview transcripts that had been coded in 2 different ways and the resultant network graphs were examined. The creation of network graphs allows researchers an opportunity to view and share their qualitative data in an innovative way that may provide new insights and enhance transparency of the analytical process by which they reach their conclusions.},

I argue with Pawson's interpretation of critical realism's positions on both natural and social science and his charges concerning its totalizing ontology, its arrogant epistemology and its naive methodology. The differences between critical realism and realist evaluation are not as significant as Pawson contends. The main differences between the two realisms lie in their approaches to the relationship between social structures and human agency, and between facts and values. I argue that evaluation scientists need to clearly distinguish structure and agency. They should also make their values explicit. The uncritical approach of realist evaluation, combined with its underplaying of the importance of agency, leaves it open to implication in the abuses of bureaucratic instrumentalism.},

Do their perceptions match up with the theories of change constructed by organisations trying to support them? This case study looks at a project which has the goal of increasing the economic empowerment of women in Ghana, implemented by Opportunity International UK (OIUK), an NGO working in international development. A mid-term evaluation was carried out using the Qualitative Impact Protocol (QuIP) methodology to gather stories of change, and reasons for changes, directly from project participants. These stories were analysed and visualised using a web application called Causal Map. The first part of this chapter presents causal mapping as a group of methods with much to offer strategic thinking in evaluation. It explains how both theories of change on the one hand, and the type of evidence gathered for evaluations such as these on the other, can be understood as different types of causal map. The second part presents how the causal maps produced in the evaluation were used to answer evaluation questions, in particular by comparing the resulting causal maps with the project's original theory of change. It also discussed some important differences revealed by this comparison and how it was used to enrich OIUK's strategic thinking and update the theory of change for the next phase of the project.}

The fruit of that intervention and that relationship are still with us. In this contribution I would like firstly to give a brief overview of some of these cooperation and research activities. In the second part of this contribution I will then present one interesting but previously unpublished result from the research conducted during that decade. This comes from a strand of investigation which we had begun in order to complement the more classical approach to research on post-traumatic stress disorder (\{PTSD\}) which we had adopted in the published papers, which is more focused on problems associated with the post-war situation and which puts those published results in a different perspective. The concept in question we named ``ethno-political distress''. It covers aspects of the post-war situation which we believe to make a contribution to mental health and distress but which have not to date received sufficient attention. So the title of this contribution, ``postwar developments'', refers both to the development of clinical psychology in the countries of former Yugoslavia to which we tried to contribute, and to some problematic aspects of post-war development at the individual level.},

  abstract = {a) The research carried out Eight different samples of citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina were assessed in 1998 and 1999, two to four years after the end of the 1992-5 war, covering a wide range of variables including traumatic and stressful experiences and various measures of psychosocial adaptation including \{PTSD\}. b) Main results and conclusion The results were published in nine papers which are described in this Context Statement, and which are also included as Appendices. Taken together, the specific (and sometimes tragic) features of the conflict in B\$\textbackslash backslash\$\&H, and some strengths of the research design, enabled the papers to make a significant contribution to three key psychological themes. The first theme was \{PTSD\} concept and measurement. The psychometric performance of mea- sures of \{PTSD\} in B\$\textbackslash backslash\$\&H were found to be similar to other published results, suggesting that the construct is as valid for the B\$\textbackslash backslash\$\&H population as for the comparison populations on which the instrument was developed. The case is also made for dropping Criterion A from the \{DSM\} \{PTSD\} diagnosis altogether, on the grounds of overwhelming practical and conceptual problems with assessing it using populations with multiple stressors. The second theme was epidemiology and aetiology of \{PTSD\} and other symptom groups. Quite apart from \{PTSD\}, the war had a very significant impact on general mental health across the population. Current \{PTSD\} prevalences in the non-treatment samples ranged from 11\$\textbackslash backslash\$\% amongst returned refugees to 36\$\textbackslash backslash\$\% amongst internally displaced persons (\{IDPs\}) in camps, which are in line with the literature. Beyond \{PTSD\}, impact was concentrated in particularly high levels of somatisation, paranoid ideation, and aggression. \{PTSD\} prevalences amongst returned refugees are clearly lower than those of their peers who stayed in host countries, and much lower than all known reports in refugee samples abroad. Analysis of persons in treatment suggests that those who seek treatment for \{PTSD\} (as opposed to other medical problems) do have high levels of \{PTSD\} symptoms speci{$\dottedsquare$}cally, but not necessarily because they experienced a larger number of traumatic events. The third theme looked beyond psychopathology. Findings suggest that the concept of post- traumatic growth can be validly extended to this population, but levels were considerably lower than reported in most other studies on other kinds of traumatic event. Finally \{PTSD\} and the \{PTSD\} diagnosis are discussed in a broader social context and it is concluded that while the war had many different kinds of consequences beyond the purely clinical, this should not divert attention from the fact that individual, clinically-relevant suffering was prevalent in the population at levels warranting urgent attention from public health care.},

  abstract = {This chapter explores the use of mechanisms within the realist evaluation of the Building Capacity to Use Research Evidence (BCURE) program, a \textbackslash pounds15.7 million initiative aiming to improve the use of evidence in decision-making in low and middle-income countries. The evaluation was commissioned to establish not just whether BCURE worked but also how and why capacity building can contribute to increased use of evidence in policymaking in the very different contexts in which the program operated. This chapter argues that using mechanisms helped provide nuanced and robust insights into these questions, while also strengthening the usefulness and policy relevance of the evaluation. Drawing primarily on qualitative data, including interviews with more than 500 stakeholders over 3 years, the evaluation explored the mechanisms that promote capacities to use evidence in decision-making, through developing and testing realist context-intervention-mechanism-outcome configurations (CIMOs). Uncovering the value of mechanisms for policy and program learning was not easy, and the chapter sets out some of the thorny challenges faced and how the BCURE evaluation navigated these. Ultimately, the use of mechanisms in the BCURE evaluation helped to generate practical and nuanced insights that fed directly into the design of a \textbackslash pounds17 million follow-up program. The seven mechanisms uncovered are continuing to inform our own and others' work on institutional capacity change in a wide range of fields.},

Management and organization studies are yet to (fully) leverage these methods. We argue that ML algorithms can benefit both qualitative researchers engaged in a small number of cases and quantitative researchers faced with a large number of observations. Such benefits arise from the ability of ML techniques to facilitate ``algorithmic induction''\textemdash a form of inductive inference that yields identical (or highly similar) conclusions when applied by different observers to the same data. Algorithmic induction is valuable for researchers interested in theorizing through interpretative and comparative case analysis as well as generating hypotheses from large sets of quantitative data (followed by traditional testing approaches). We introduce variants of ML algorithms to management and organization researchers, develop the concept of algorithmic induction, and discuss its general potential for inductive theorizing in the field.},

In their formulation, the causal conjuncture is a sequence of conditions or events. The authors applaud their effort and agree that it is important to address this aspect of causation. This comment clarifies and corrects aspects of their analysis and present methods for assessing temporality that are more amenable to truth table analysis and the use of existing software, fsQCA. The methods presented utilize codings that indicate event order in addition to codings that indicate whether specific events occurred. They also demonstrate how to use ``don't care'' codings to bypass consideration of event sequences when they are not relevant (e.g., as when only a single event occurs).},

\par
"QCA's home
base is comparative sociology/comparative politics, where there is a
strong tradition of case-oriented work alongside an extensive and growing
body of quantitative cross-national research. The case-oriented tradition
is much older and is populated largely by area and country experts. In
contrast to the situation of qualitative researchers in most social
scientific subdisciplines, these case oriented researchers have high
status, primarily because their case knowledge is useful to the state
(e.g., in its effort to maintain or enhance national security) and other
corporate actors. Case-oriented researchers are often critical of
quantitative cross-national researchers for ignoring the gap between the
results of quantitative research and what is known about specific cases.
They also have little interest in the abstract, high-level concepts that
often characterize this type of research and the wide analytic gulf
separating these concepts from case-level events and processes. QCA, plain
and simple, attempts to bridge these two worlds" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5V85DJPB?page=2}{Ragin
:20})
\par
"Note also that important causal relations, necessity and
sufficiency, are indicated when certain set relations exist: With
necessity, the outcome is a subset of the causal condition; with
sufficiency, the causal condition is a subset of the outcome" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5V85DJPB?page=4}{Ragin
:22})
\par
"Consistency scores of either 1 or 0 indicate perfect
consistency for a given row. A score of 0.50 indicates perfect
inconsistency. 2-3. Identify contradictory rows. Technically, a
contradictory row is any row with a consistency score that is not equal to
1 or 0. However, it is sometimes reasonable to relax this standard, for
example, if an inconsistent case in a given row can be explained by its
specific circumstances. 2-4. Compare cases within each contradictory rows.
If possible, identify decisive differences between positive and negative
cases, and then revise the truth table accordingly" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5V85DJPB?page=7}{Ragin
:25})
\par
"fsQCA software can be used to analyze truth tables like
the two just shown. The goal of the analysis is to specify the different
combinations of conditions linked to the selected outcome, based on the
features of the positive cases that consistently distinguish them from the
negative cases." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5V85DJPB?page=11}{Ragin
:29})
\par
"This process of bottom-up paired comparison continues
until no further simplification is possible. Only rows with the outcome
are paired; only one condition may differ in each paired comparison. The
one that differs is eliminated" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5V85DJPB?page=11}{Ragin
:29})
\par
"Rows without cases ("remainders") also may be used to aid
the process of simplifying the patterns. For example, there are no
instances of the second row listed below. However, based on substantive
and theoretical knowledge, it is reasonable to speculate that if such
cases existed, they would be positive instances of IMF protest, just like
the empirical cases they are paired with: Prior mobiliz.? Severe
austerity? Gov't corrupt? Rapid price rise? Not Repressive? Cases w/
protest? Cases w/o protest Consis- tency 0 (no) 1 (yes) 0 (no) 1 (yes) 0
(no) 0 1.0 0 (yes) 1 (yes) 1 (yes) 1 (yes) 0 (no) 0 0 The reasoning is as
follows: (1) the remainder case resembles the empirical cases above it in
every respect except one; (2) the one difference (the remainder case has
government corruption) involves a condition that should only make IMF
protest more likely; (3) therefore, the remainder case, if it existed,
would display IMF protest, just like the empirical cases. This pairing
allows the production of a logically simpler configuration, eliminating
the absence of government corruption as a possible (INUS) ingredient." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5V85DJPB?page=12}{Ragin
:30})
\par
"3) an "intermediate" solution, which uses only the
remainders that survive counterfactual analysis based on theoretical and
substantive knowledge (which is input by the user). Generally,
intermediate solutions are best" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5V85DJPB?page=13}{Ragin
:31})
\par
"Because they are logical statements, these two recipes for
IMF protest can be factored" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5V85DJPB?page=14}{Ragin
:32})
\par
"4-3. Conduct additional case-level analysis with an eye
toward the mechanisms implied in each recipe. Causal processes can be
studied only at the case level, so it is important to evaluate them at
that level" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5V85DJPB?page=15}{Ragin :33})},

Arguably, the most widely used definition of a program effect is the counterfactual one.

Such a definition is often said to be linked to the use of quantitative methods. But the definition can be used just as effectively with qualitative methods.

4: Just-Tell-Me Assessments Another assessment option (most often used by

result of some action it seems common-sense just to ask them" (p. 413). I

just-tell-me question, an evaluator could have program participants either
think forward or backward" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BJJD6JEW?page=6}{Reichardt 2022:109821402097553})

"It is
possible an alternative, noncounterfactual method of answering the
just-tell-me questions could be used, but, as far as I know, such an
alternative has not been specified by evaluators. In any case, using an

7: The MO Method Scriven (1976, 2009) champions the MO method. The logic

whether the signatures are present. The presence of signatures of the
program and the absence of signatures for alternative causes suggest the
program was responsible for observed results. Scriven (1976) gives an

  abstract = {Ideas from complexity science and systems thinking are demonstrably helpful in a shift from exploring (systematic) linear net effects of an intervention towards exploring wider (systemic) effects occurring elsewhere. But where these ideas of `impact' are coupled with a narrow use of the contingency approach, some less helpful `triangulated' relationships might be evident. These relationships might be regarded in terms of an `iron triangle', a metaphor used frequently to exemplify pernicious relations of power. The most notable expression of the iron triangle is the `military\textendash industrial complex'. This article briefly outlines generic features of the iron triangle in terms of `systemic triangulation' \textendash{} an idea linking three core systems concepts of interrelationships, perspectives and boundaries. Drawing on a tradition of systems thinking in practice, an associated systemic triangulator is introduced as both a diagnostic and planning heuristic; a device for not only diagnosing symptoms of an evaluation\textendash industrial complex but for prompting ideas towards a more benign evaluation\textendash adaptive complex for impact evaluation.},

  author = {Richardson, Neil},
  year = {2016},
  volume = {15},
  abstract = {SODA, SSM, CSH and SD are hardly trendy acronyms; even among practicing managers they won't enjoy widespread recognition. Authors Reynolds and Holwell explain the novel termi-nology points to radical approaches in organisational research: participative ways of interven-ing in complex dilemmas troubled by uncertainty. These approaches are therefore not techniques for solving easily-defined problems but are means for tackling social 'messes'. If social problem X is opaque, awkward to express in words, then the interesting modes of research discussed in this book might be a good idea. The group or advisor troubled by X would choose an approach which seems easy to understand and put to work, perhaps one that can be used again after an itinerant consultancy team has moved on. Yet this line of thought puts a huge burden on the approach architect: to draft principles amenable to multifarious men and women -whatever their histories, ambition and foibles \textendash{} and which also help make sense of fuzzy, never-to-be-repeated organisational dilemmas. Occasionally the writing in SAMC strays too far from lay readers' backgrounds, people who ought to be kept on-board if participation is sought. Although the first chapter shows how research principles have been grouped together by several authors, the categorising can be controversial; for instance, in figure 1.2 the work of Jackson, Ulrich, and Flood points towards a bubble labelled critical systems, while Open University and Checkland points to a very general label of applied systems studies rather than his innovation SSM or the phrase soft systems, an unusual slant. In chapter two Dr John Morecroft describes Systems Dynamics, an approach linked to Jay Forrester's research and The Fifth Discipline of Peter Senge. Examples of mixing hot and cold flows in a shower (with annoying time delays) and the relation between hunger and food give the gist of Systems Dynamics, before complex settings of drug related crime Philosophy of Management (2016) 15:251\textendash 254 and airline marketing. An arrow which links Hunger with Amount Eaten is shown as positive \textendash{} with another counteracting effect (negative) from Amount Eaten to Hunger, thus appetites are balanced. However, it may be that habit, stress or flavourings keep Joe eating well beyond a recommended balance. Another contrary notion is whether an increase in the number of police allocated to drug busting will increase drug seizures (figure 2.19) when wise guys in that trade learn from their mistakes. The mathematical nature of SD \textendash{} including skill in 'writing good algebra' with 'equations that mean what you intend' -appears on computer simulators, putting this programme beyond the budget of many organisations and into the hands of consultants. Even a thousand lines of their expert algebra will capture neither how reality 'actually is' nor tomorrow's insights for change. Patrick Hoverstadt briefs readers on the Virtual System Model in chapter three, reliant on the texts of Stafford Beer and his 'laws of viable organisation'. Deploying five sub-systems and a principle of recursion, Beer's VSM model allows comparisons against real organisations. As examples of system descriptions, S2 is a sub-system of activities which stop different operations causing problems for one another, while S5 is comprised of management activities which ensure the organisation works as a system. Does the generality of S5 make S2 redundant? No methodology is required here, an omission which might puzzle those unfamil-iar with organisational research. One principle is stressed: Only variety can absorb variety. Figure 3.3 (Balancing the complexity equation) shows how an organisation (presumably its executives) reduces variety of the environment into market segments, subsequently reduced by management into divisions which handle complex tasks. Management and the organisation can also amplify their own variety, for instance by 'increasing divisional autonomy'. This so called 'balancing act' might be translated into the modest claim that various groups at various times will do their best to satisfy events and trends, no algebraic dexterity required, and not a simultaneous equation in sight. Chapter four's SODA (Strategic Options and Analysis) by Fran Ackermann and Colin Eden can explore options within tricky situations via a means-ends network, supported where necessary by causal mapping software and based on theories from cognitive psychology and social negotiation. In general, moving from the top to bottom of these networks we first encounter consequences and objectives above a central issue, then, at the diagram's base are constraints and options. Since the authors advise working with multiple perspectives and construe events differently, they may allow doubts about their Process \& Content diagram (Figure 4.2). Instead of aligning Process with 'power, skills and personalities' and Content with 'capturing and analysing data and analysing problem statements' \textendash{} the labels make more sense when flipped: the content of a study would include a note on the power, skills and personalities encountered within the client organisation. With SODA exercises collecting up to sixty statements during forty-five minutes of discussion and the need for the computer-based tool Decision Explorer when models become large, this systems approach is another requiring expert input. Bewitched by language? A simple string of words might trouble newcomers. For instance, figure 4.7 includes three linked phrases,},

Answers also depended on whether the device is deterministic or probabilistic-whether X's causal parents "always" or only "usually" cause X to operate.

  abstract = {Background: Approval for the use of COVID-19 vaccines has been granted in a number of countries but there are concerns that vaccine uptake may be low amongst certain groups. Methods: This study used a mixed methods approach based on online survey and an embedded quantitative/qualitative design to explore perceptions and attitudes that were associated with intention to either accept or refuse offers of vaccination in different demographic groups during the early stages of the UK's mass COVID-19 vaccination programme (December 2020). Analysis used multivariate logistic regression, structural text modeling and anthropological assessments. Results: Of 4,535 respondents, 85\% (n = 3,859) were willing to have a COVID-19 vaccine. The rapidity of vaccine development and uncertainties about safety were common reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. There was no evidence for the widespread influence of mis-information, although broader vaccine hesitancy was associated with intentions to refuse COVID-19 vaccines (OR 20.60, 95\% CI 14.20-30.30, p {$<$} 0.001). Low levels of trust in the decision-making (OR 1.63, 95\% CI 1.08, 2.48, p = 0.021) and truthfulness (OR 8.76, 95\% CI 4.15-19.90, p {$<$} 0.001) of the UK government were independently associated with higher odds of refusing COVID-19 vaccines. Compared to political centrists, conservatives and liberals were, respectively, more (OR 2.05, 95\%CI 1.51-2.80, p {$<$} 0.001) and less (OR 0.30, 95\% CI 0.22-0.41, p {$<$} 0.001) likely to refuse offered vaccines. Those who were willing to be vaccinated cited both personal and public protection as reasons, with some alluding to having a sense of collective responsibility. Conclusion: Dominant narratives of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy are misconceived as primarily being driven by misinformation. Key indicators of UK vaccine acceptance include prior behaviors, transparency of the scientific process of vaccine development, mistrust in science and leadership and individual political views. Vaccine programmes should leverage the sense of altruism, citizenship and collective responsibility that motivated many participants to get vaccinated.},

Complicated programme theory may be used to represent interventions with multiple components, multiple agencies, multiple simultaneous causal strands and/or multiple alternative causal strands. Complex programme theory may be used to represent recursive causality (with reinforcing loops), disproportionate relationships (where at critical levels, a small change can make a big difference \textemdash{} a `tipping point') and emergent outcomes.}

In addition to debates about the meaning of the simulation results, there is a more fundamental discussion about whether simulations promise any relevant insights in principle. Some voices in the QCA community reject simulations per se because they necessarily lack case knowledge. As a consequence, the debate is at an impasse on a metalevel because critics of QCA rely on simulations, the results of which some QCA proponents refuse to consider as insightful. This article addresses this impasse and presents six reasons why simulations must be considered appropriate for evaluating QCA.

The way forward in this debate should not be about whether simulations are useful, but how to configure meaningful simulations evaluating QCA.},

A model of causation that describes causes in terms of sufficient causes and their component causes illuminates important principles such as multi-causality, the dependence of the strength of component causes on the prevalence of complementary component causes, and interaction between component causes. Philosophers agree that causal propositions cannot be proved, and find flaws or practical limitations in all philosophies of causal inference. Hence, the role of logic, belief, and observation in evaluating causal propositions is not settled. Causal inference in epidemiology is better viewed as an exercise in measurement of an effect rather than as a criterion-guided process for deciding whether an effect is present or not.}

I observe that agency is the breaking of an approximation under which dynamics appears closed. I distinguish different notions of agency, and observe that the answer to the questions above differ in different cases. I notice a structural similarity between agency and memory, that allows us to model agency, trace its time asymmetry to thermodynamical irreversibility, and identify the source of the information generated by agency in the growth of entropy. Agency is therefore a physical mechanism that transforms low entropy into information. This may be the general mechanism at the source of the whole information on which biology builds.},

Using the five basic axioms cited by Guba and Lincoln in \{"Epistemological\} and Methodological Bases of Naturalistic Inquiry," the author compares and contrasts an Eastern paradigm of evaluation to the rationalistic and naturalistic paradigms, and offers suggestions for methodological practices that one who subscribes to such a paradigm might follow.

The techniques described here are drawn from across epistemological and disciplinary boundaries. They include both observational and manipulative techniques and range from quick word counts to laborious, in-depth, line-by-line scrutiny. Techniques are compared on six dimensions: (1) appropriateness for data types, (2) required labor, (3) required expertise, (4) stage of analysis, (5) number and types of themes to be generated, and (6) issues of reliability and validity.},

"The Ontology of Causation The second dimension of
variance concerns the ontology of causation, that is, the question of what
types of entities can stand in causal relations. The answers to that
question are influenced by two conflicting intuitions. On the one hand, it
seems that causes and effects are entities that occur in time and space.
For example, elections are causes of policy changes or peasant revolts are
causes of social revolutions. Causes and their effects are items we can
point to. On the other hand, absences and omissions are often causally
interpreted as well, even" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=346}{
:2046})
\par
"Corresponding to these two intuitions, there are two
main candidate ontologies of causation: according to the first, causes and
effects are events (e.g. Davidson, 1967), according to the second they are
facts (e.g." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=347}{
:2047})
\par
"Yet, neither ontology is clearly preferable; there are
persuasive arguments for and against both ontologies (cf. Ehring, 2009).
For that reason it has become customary to bracket the question as to the
ontology of causation by remaining as non-committal as possible with
regard to the nature of causes and effects. This is accomplished by
referring to causes and effects simply as variables, factors, or values of
variables/factors. Random variables and factors are flexible modeling
devices that can be used to represent any types of entities." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=347}{

"General vs. Singular Causation Two kinds of causation
must be distinguished: one on the type level, general or type causation
(often also called causal relevance), and one on the token level, singular
or token causation (often also called actual causation" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=347}{
:2047})
\par
"As we shall see below, some theories take general
causation to be primary, others opt for singular causation." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=347}{
:2047})
\par
"Causation, both on type and on token level, is usually
analyzed as a relation '... is causally relevant to ...' or '... is a
singular cause of ...', where the dots are filled by the corresponding
causes and effects" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=348}{

"Some relational properties of causation are
uncontroversial. For instance, general and singular causation are neither
reflexive nor symmetric. That is, a cause is normally neither caused" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=348}{

raises may be causally relevant to lay-offs" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=348}{

"The difference between realism and antirealism is not
just of philosophical interest. It has a direct bearing on what counts as
empirical evidence for causation. To establish causation, the anti-realist
only has to demonstrate the existence of the required behavior pattern in
the data - and behavior patterns are exactly what is contained in ordinary
data. By contrast, the realist has to furnish evidence" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=349}{

to be developed today. They date back to Hume (1748). The most influential
modern regularity theory is due to Mackie (1974) - with refinements by
Gra\ss hoff and May (2001) and Baumgartner (2013)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=350}{

crisp-set, taking two possible values 0 and 1, fuzzy-set, taking

\par
"Many of these Boolean dependencies, however, have
nothing to do with causation. For example, the sinking of a (properly
functioning) barometer is sufficient for weather changes" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=351}{
:2051})
\par
"That means the crucial problem to be solved by a
regularity theory is to filter out those Boolean dependencies that are due
to underlying causal dependencies and are, hence, amenable to a causal
interpretation." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=351}{
:2051})
\par
"The main reason why most structures of Boolean
dependencies do not reflect causation is that they tend to contain
redundancies, whereas structures of causal dependencies do not feature
redundant elements. Every part of a causal structure makes a difference to
the behavior of that structure in at least one context. Accordingly, to
filter out the causally interpretable Boolean dependencies, they need to
be freed of redundancies. Only those elements of sufficient and necessary
conditions can be causally relevant which are indispensable to account for
a scrutinized outcome in at least one" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=351}{
:2051})
\par
"Or in Mackie's words, causes are at least INUS
conditions, viz. Insufficient but Non-redundant parts of Unnecessary but
Sufficient conditions (1974: 62). Whatever can be removed from" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=351}{

\par
"necessary conditions without affecting their sufficiency
and necessity is not a difference-maker and, hence, not a cause. The
causally interesting sufficient and necessary conditions are minimal in
the sense that they do not contain sufficient and necessary proper parts,
respectively" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=351}{
:2051})
\par
"Moreover, although minimal theories as (1) have a main
operator ('{$\leftrightarrow$}') that is symmetric, to the effect that both sides of (1) are
mutually sufficient and necessary for one another, the fact that (1)
features two minimally sufficient conditions of B yields that it
nonetheless identifies a direction of determination: both A*e and C*d
determine B, but B neither determines A*e nor C*d. Hence, A*e and C*d are
the (alternative) causes of B, and not vice versa" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=351}{
:2051})
\par
"Still, to define causal relevance by means of minimal
theories, an additional constraint is needed, for not all minimal theories
faithfully reflect causation." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=351}{
:2051})
\par
"In other words, by expanding factor sets, factor values
that appear to be non-redundant to account for an outcome can turn out to
be redundant after all. Therefore, only factor values that are not
rendered redundant by expanding factor sets are causally relevant" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=352}{
:2052})
\par
"Probabilistic Theory The restriction of regularity
theories to deterministic contexts has prompted probabilistic theories to
abandon the assumption that causation is deterministic. Still, like
regularity theories, probabilistic accounts are difference-making theories
that are committed to causal anti-realism, and they do not entail that
causation is transitive" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=352}{
:2052})
\par
"However, not all cases of probability-raising are also
cases of causation" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=352}{
:2052})
\par
"First, probability-raising is symmetric: if A raises the
probability of B, then B also raises the probability of A. But causation
is not symmetric. There are various ways to address that problem. For
instance, in complex networks of probabilistic (in-)dependencies,
so-called Bayesian networks, it is possible to infer the direction of
causation from substructures featuring multiple independent paths to the
same effect, so-called unshielded colliders (Spirtes et al., 2000: chapter
5)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=352}{
:2052})
\par
"More generally, the set of common causes, C, of two
parallel effects, A and B, neutralizes or screens off the probabilistic
dependence between A and B in the following sense (Reichenbach, 1956)
(where '*' again stands for conjunction)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=353}{
:2053})

"Probabilistic dependencies inferred from relative
frequencies in the whole population, however, may be reversed or
neutralized in subpopulations, which is a very common phenomenon in
statistics known as Simpson's Paradox" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=353}{
:2053})
\par
"Overall, (P2) avoids the problems of (P1), but it does
so at the price of abandoning the project of defining causation in
non-causal terms" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=354}{
:2054})
\par
"Counterfactual Theory A theoretical framework not
prepared to give up reductionism is the so-called counterfactual one. Like
regularity theories, counterfactual theories have their roots in
suggestions by Hume (1748). Lewis (1973; 2000) developed Hume's ideas into
a full-blown theory" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=354}{
:2054})
\par
"Contrary to the previously discussed theories, it
stipulates that causation is transitive, it focuses on singular causation
as primary analysandum, and it takes a determinate stance on the ontology
of causation by assuming that causes and effects are spatiotemporally
located events" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=354}{
:2054})
\par
"The main idea behind a counterfactual theory is to
define singular causation between two occurring events, {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$}, in terms
of the truth of a counterfactual conditional of the form 'had {$\alpha$} not
occurred, {$\beta$} would not have occurred" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=354}{
:2054})
\par
"To render the truth conditions of counterfactual
statements precise, it is standard to draw on so-called possible world
semantics, which was developed in modal logic to explicate the meanings of
claims about possibility and necessity" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=354}{
:2054})
\par
"possible world, w, can be thought of as a (hypothetical)
maximal state of affairs such that every state of affairs is either
included in w or precluded by w. There is a possible world in which McCain
(and not Obama) becomes president in 2008, Italy is in Africa (and not in
Europe), Caesar (and not Armstrong) is the first man on the moon, Archduke
Ferdinand is not assassinated but lives to be 80 years old, etc" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=354}{
:2054})
\par
"To avoid these consequences, Lewis stipulates that a
non-{$\alpha$}-world, w, counts as similar to the actual world if all states of
affairs in w coincide with the actual world up until the occurrence of {$\alpha$},
at which moment a law of nature of the actual world is broken in w by a
so-called divergence miracle suppressing {$\alpha$} in w. If, and only if, after
that miracle, {$\beta$} does not occur in w, {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} are counterfactually
dependent. Counterfactual dependence is sufficient but not necessary for
causation because counterfactual dependence is not transitive. To ensure
that causation is transitive, Lewis (1973) defines causation to be the
transitive closure of counterfactual dependence: (C) {$\alpha$} is a token-level
cause of {$\beta$}, where {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} are events in the actual world, iff there exists
a sequence of events {$\langle\alpha$}, {$\sigma$}1, ..., {$\sigma$}n, {$\beta\rangle$}, with n {$\geq$} 0, such that each event
in the sequence counterfactually depends on its predecessor" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=355}{
:2055})
\par
"Interventionist Theory The so-called interventionist
framework provides another non-reductionist approach to defining
causation. Interventionist theories have a lot of intuitive appeal and
enjoy growing popularity. They tie the notion of causation directly to the
way we commonly discover causation: by suitably manipulating factors of
interest. Causes are those factors that can be manipulated in such a way
that other factors" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=355}{
:2055})
\par
"the most compelling interventionist theories define
causation in terms of a technical notion of an intervention that is
independent of human agency (e.g. Woodward, 2003; Pearl, 2009). This
section focuses on the currently most widely used interventionist theory,
which is due to Woodward (2003)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=356}{
:2056})
\par
"Woodward chooses general causation as primary
analysandum, develops an antirealist difference-making theory and neither
assumes causation to be deterministic nor transitive. He also remains
non-committal with respect to the ontology of causation by referring to
causes and effects as variables or factors - in contrast to, say,
regularity theories that take causes and effects to be factor values. The
difference between factors and factor values seems small but is
substantial. A factor, A, is causally relevant for a factor, B, (according
to Woodward) iff at least one of A's values can make a difference to at
least one of B's values, but in order for A=1 to be causally relevant to
B=1, not any value of A but the specific value, 1, must be the
difference-maker for the specific value 1 of B." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=356}{
:2056})
\par
"The crucial requirement that T has to comply with in
order to serve its designated purpose is non-confounding" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=356}{
:2056})
\par
"I) A is a type-level cause of B iff there exists a
possible intervention on A with respect to B that is associated with a
change in B when all off-path causes of B are held fixed." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=356}{
:2056})
\par
"Some features of that theory deserve separate emphasis.
First, it is non-reductionist because it defines causation in terms of
interventions, which are certain designated causes. According to (I),
determining whether A is a cause of B requires some prior causal knowledge
about the causes of A and B, not however, about the relationship between A
and B itself (i.e. the theory is not circular" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=356}{
:2056})
\par
"Whenever no intervention on A actually occurs, the
question thus arises whether such an intervention is possible and what
would happen to B were such an intervention to occur. Answering those
questions calls for recourse to possible world semantics, which, in turn,
has led to interventionist theories being characterized as (type-level)
variants of counterfactual theories" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=357}{
:2057})
\par
"The main problem of (I) stems from the fact that it not
only treats recoverability by an interventionist T-test as sufficient for
causation - which it uncontroversially is - but also as necessary for it.
(I) entails that, if it is impossible to surgically cause A (i.e. to
intervene on A), A is causally inert" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=357}{
:2057})
\par
"Mechanistic Theory Finally, contrary to all previously
discussed theories, mechanistic theories subscribe to causal realism," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=357}{
:2057})
\par
"only causes and effects exist in the world but also the
relation connecting them. There are two types of mechanistic theories:
process theories (e.g. Dowe, 2000) and complex systems theories (e.g.
Glennan, 1996). Process theories define causation in terms of the
transmission of energy or momentum from causes to effects. They are
tailor-made to account for causation in physical systems and are only of
minor relevance for social and political science" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=357}{
:2057})
\par
"According to this approach, the characteristic feature
of causes is not that they are difference-makers of their effects but that
they produce them. As production is a causally loaded notion, resulting
theories are non-reductionist." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=357}{
:2057})
\par
"By contrast, they take a decisive stance on the ontology
of causation: causes and effects are spatiotemporally located entities,
that is, events. Correspondingly, their primary analysandum is singular
causation" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=357}{
:2057})

"In any case, causation between events on a fundamental
level cannot be understood in the vein of (M), which is why Glennan
restricts the applicability of (M) to non-fundamental events." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B6KEUQWP?page=358}{ :2058})},

"While journals in a few disciplines continue to permit scholars to
publish discursive footnotes, most social sciences have gone in the

all journals now use in-text ("scientific") citations, designed for
nonqualitative scholarship that cites only other secondary scholarship, or
simple citations that sometimes lack detail (e.g., page numbers), almost
never include quotations or interpretation and require that any curious
reader track down the original source. The decline of standard word limits

The parallel mechanism introduced in this paper has the advantage of mechanical and kinematic simplicity when compared to existing platforms while at the same time it is fully capable of carrying out all the exercises required by ankle rehabilitation protocols. The proposed device makes use of actuation redundancy to eliminate singularity and greatly improve the workspace dexterity. In addition, the requirements for high torque capacity and back-drivability are satisfied with the employment of a custom made cable driven linear electric actuator that combines the high force capacity with excellent back-drivability. The analysis undergoes the optimal design towards the maximization of manipulator workspace, dexterity, torque output and compactness of the device. Finally, the performance of the custom linear actuator and the prototype of the rehabilitation device are shown.}

  abstract = {In the social sciences, there is a longstanding tension between data collection methods that facilitate quantification and those that are open to unanticipated information. Advances in technology now enable new, hybrid methods that combine some of the benefits of both approaches. Drawing inspiration from online information aggregation systems like Wikipedia and from traditional survey research, we propose a new class of research instruments called wiki surveys. Just as Wikipedia evolves over time based on contributions from participants, we envision an evolving survey driven by contributions from respondents. We develop three general principles that underlie wiki surveys: they should be greedy, collaborative, and adaptive. Building on these principles, we develop methods for data collection and data analysis for one type of wiki survey, a pairwise wiki survey. Using two proof-of-concept case studies involving our free and open-source website www.allourideas.org, we show that pairwise wiki surveys can yield insights that would be difficult to obtain with other methods.},

A common question is whether one should use the provided weights to
perform weighted least squares when doing regression analysis. Such a
course of action may lead to incorrect estimates. If particular groups
follow significantly different regression specifications, the preferred
method of analysis is to estimate a separate regression for each group or
to use indicator variables to specify group membership; regression on a
random sample of the population would be misspecified. Users uncertain
about the appropriate method should consult an econometrician,
statistician, or other person knowledgeable about the data before
specifying the regression model.

The solution is to alter the algorithm we use to handle inconsistency in premise sets: rather than checking all maximally consistent fragments of a premise sets, as in Krazter's semantics, we selectively remove some of the premises. The proposed implementation starts from standard premise semantics and involves a new 'filtering' operation that achieves just this removal. The resulting semantics is interestingly related to the semantics for counterfactuals emerging from Judea Pearl's causal models framework in computer science: in particular, filtering is a possible worlds semantics counterpart of Pearl's interventions.\textbackslash textless/p\textbackslash textgreater}

The methodology adopted in this work consisted both in the construction of a causal map, based on interviews with stakeholders of Santa Catarina native forests, and in the analysis of the map using techniques of the Strategic Options Development and Analysis (SODA) approach. The analyses carried out indicated that the economic valuation of forest resources as well as the monitoring of forest cover are key issues for the management of Santa Catarina's native forests. In addition, the information generated by the causal map analysis can assist not only the process of designing innovative and all-inclusive policies for the management of native forests, but also the modeling process based on Systems Dynamics in order to evaluate the impacts of policies on the dynamics that govern the conservation and use of the resources of native forests. The adopted SODA approach also proved to be effective in structuring the complex problem situation addressed in this study.},

Recent innovations in LFA theory and practice have led to a Third Generation of LFA use resulting in its increased effectiveness and practicality as a tool for designing, implementing and evaluating agricultural research projects. Amongst these innovations are: 1) team-based (or participatory) use of the LFA; 2) guidelines for applying the LFA to research projects; 3) LFA software, enabling much more dynamic use of the approach; 4) better integration of the LFA with other project implementation tools; 5) better understanding of practical indicators for project performance and supporting monitoring and evaluation methods and; 6) a better understanding of the critical success factors required for sustainable and effective LFA use within institutions. Lessons are derived from efforts to introduce the Third Generation LFA to the National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA) in Morocco.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               To make effective progress towards a global reduction in obesity prevalence, there needs to be a focus on broader structural factors, beyond individual-level drivers of diet and physical activity. This article describes the use of a systems framework to develop obesity prevention policies with adolescents. The aim of this research was to use the group model building (GMB) method to identify young people's perceptions of the drivers of adolescent obesity in five European countries, as part of the EU-funded Co-Create project.                                         Methods               We used GMB with four groups of 16\textendash 18-year-old in schools in each of the five European countries (The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal and the UK) to create causal loop diagrams (CLDs) representing their perceptions of the drivers of adolescent obesity. The maps were then merged into one, using a new protocol.                                         Results               Two hundred and fifty-seven participants, aged 16\textendash 18 years, engaged in 20 separate system mapping groups, each of which generated 1 CLD. The findings were largely congruent between the countries. Three feedback loops in the merged diagram particularly stand out: commercial drivers of unhealthy diets; mental health and unhealthy diets; social media use, body image and motivation to exercise.                                         Conclusions               GMB provides a novel way of eliciting from young people the system-based drivers of obesity that are relevant to them. Mental health issues, social media use and commercial practices were considered by the young people to be key drivers of adolescent obesity, subjects that have thus far had little or no coverage in research and policy.},

  abstract = {hat conception of causation is at work in the law? I argue that the law implicitly relies on a contrastive conception. In a liability case where the defendant's breach of duty must be shown to have caused the plaintiff's damages, it is not enough to consider what would have happened if the cause had not occurred\textendash the law instructs us to look to a specific replacement for the cause, which in this case is the hypothetical scenario in which the defendant acted lawfully. And it is not enough to ask if the effect would still have occurred\textendash the law requires us to look to a specific replacement for the effect, which in this case is the hypothetical outcome in which the plaintiff came off better. In place of ``but for the defendant's breach, the plaintiff's damage would not have occurred,'' I suggest the more explicit ``if the defendant had acted lawfully, the plaintiff would have met a better fate.'' An explicitly contrastive approach can thus potentially help the lawyer phrase her causal question in a more explicit way, while shedding light on our conception of causation. According to David Hume, our concepts of causation, resemblance, and contiguity are the foundation of all of our reasoning concerning matters of fact and are ``to us the cement of the universe.''1 Our concept of causation seems crucial to legal thought. Many liability doctrines in both criminal law and torts explicitly require that the defendant has caused harm to the plaintiff.2 Assuming that the law uses our concept of causation and not its own stipulatively defined notion, our concepts of causation and of legal liability may prove mutually illuminating.},

This chapter aims to introduce the reader to the topic of causal mechanisms and synthesize significant findings on this special issue. It begins by laying out definitions and concepts of causal mechanisms in evaluation literature and proposes a two-way classification of causal mechanisms along which the chapters to this issue are structured. The chapter continues by introducing the Causal Mechanism Claim and elaborates on how analyzing causal mechanisms is expected to increase policy relevance and causal capacity in evaluations. Drawing on this issue's rich corpus of firsthand practical experience, this introduction synthesizes key lessons that support or contradict the Causal Mechanism Claim. We find that both parts of the claim\textemdash increased policy relevance and strengthened causal capacity\textemdash are supported by the authors' experiences as bundled in this issue. However, we also identify challenges related to cross-cutting issues such as communication and practical applicability and point to the importance of method integration. \textcopyright{} 2020 The Authors.

We show that recent innovations in process-tracing methodology can help solve the identified challenges and increase the strength of causal inference made when using case studies in demanding settings. For the specific task of evaluating the governance effectiveness of budget support interventions, we developed a more fine-grained causal mechanism for a sub-set of the comprehensive program theory of budget support. Moreover, based on the informal use of Bayesian logic, we have elaborated on how to increase the conclusiveness of empirical evidence for one part of the theorized causal mechanism. We argue that by establishing an explicit theorized mechanism prior to empirical research and by critically judging our evidence according to an informal Bayesian logic we can remedy some of the problems at hand in much case-study research and increase the inferential leverage in complex within-case evaluation studies.},

However, it is unclear whether the aggregation of effect estimates across heterogeneous populations will be consistent for a meaningful parameter when not all treatments are evaluated on each population. Drawing from counterfactual theory and the causal inference framework, we define the population of interest in a network meta-analysis and define the target parameter under a series of nonparametric structural assumptions. This allows us to determine the requirements for identifiability of this parameter, enabling a description of the conditions under which network meta-analysis is appropriate and when it might mislead decision making. We then adapt several modeling strategies from the causal inference literature to obtain consistent estimation of the intervention-specific mean outcome and model-independent contrasts between treatments. Finally, we perform a reanalysis of a systematic review to compare the efficacy of antibiotics on suspected or confirmed methicillin-resistant \$\textbackslash backslash\$emph\{Staphylococcus aureus\} in hospitalized patients.},

  abstract = {Text data from open-ended questions in surveys are difficult to analyze and are frequently ignored. Yet open-ended questions are important because they do not constrain respondents' answer choices. Where open-ended questions are necessary, sometimes multiple human coders hand-code answers into one of several categories. At the same time, computer scientists have made impressive advances in text mining that may allow automation of such coding. Automated algorithms do not achieve an overall accuracy high enough to entirely replace humans. We categorize open-ended questions soliciting narrative responses using text mining for easy-to-categorize answers and humans for the remainder using expected accuracies to guide the choice of the threshold delineating between ``easy'' and ``hard''. Employing multinomial boosting avoids the common practice of converting machine learning ``confidence scores'' into pseudo-probabilities. This approach is illustrated with examples from open-ended questions related to respondents' advice to a patient in a hypothetical dilemma, a follow-up probe related to respondents' perception of disclosure/privacy risk, and from a question on reasons for quitting smoking from a follow-up survey from the Ontario Smoker's Helpline. Targeting 80\% combined accuracy, we found that 54\%-80\% of the data could be categorized automatically in research surveys.},

Contents * THE TERRITORY OF EVALUATION Evaluation has an extremely
extensive territory, since it includes the substantial portion of everyday
discourse devoted to proposing, attacking, and defending evaluative claims
about food products, football teams, human behavior, global warming, and
almost everything else. The domain of professional evaluation is still
very extensive: we here distinguish seven standard sub-divisions of it,
and four other specialized domains which are less commonly categorized or
recognized as part of evaluation's domain, although substantially devoted
to it. The standard sub-divisions, which we'll call the satellite
subjects, are: performance evaluation, product evaluation, personnel
evaluation, proposal evaluation, program evaluation (which includes
practice, procedural, and process evaluation), policy analysis, and
portfolio evaluation (there is a small amount of overlap between some of
these). The specialized or core domains include two for which I coined
names now quite widely used\textemdash meta-evaluation (the evaluation of
evaluations), and intradisciplinary evaluation (the evaluation of data,
experimental designs, hypotheses, etc., which is part of normal
professional practice within every discipline). The other two specialized
domains are standard disciplines not commonly classified as divisions of
evaluation but substantially concerned with that activity as a main
subject matter, not merely for procedural (i.e., intradisciplinary) use:
ethics (normative ethics in particular) and logic (because it includes the
evaluation of arguments). The logic of evaluation has general features and
processes that are the same in all of these areas, and in the everyday
business of evaluation, but it also includes some features that are
specific to sub-sets or to individual members of the group. Many of the
standard sub-divisions have had specialists working in them for a lifetime
and have of course evolved sophisticated technical vocabularies and models
of their own. Of course, some of this specialized knowledge will usually
have to be mastered in order to make a contribution to the sub-area,
although the amount varies considerably by area. THE POSSIBILITY OF

although substantially devoted to it. The standard sub-divisions, which
we'll call the satellite subjects, are: performance evaluation, product
evaluation, personnel evaluation, proposal evaluation, program evaluation
(which includes practice, procedural, and process evaluation), policy
analysis, and portfolio evaluation (there is a small amount of overlap
between some of these). The specialized or core domains include two for
which I coined names now quite widely used\textemdash meta-evaluation (the evaluation
of evaluations), and intradisciplinary evaluation (the evaluation of data,
experimental designs, hypotheses, etc., which is part of normal
professional practice within every discipline). The other two specialized
domains are standard disciplines not commonly classified as divisions of
evaluation but substantially concerned with that activity as a main
subject matter, not merely for procedural (i.e., intradisciplinary) use:
ethics (normative ethics in particular) and logic (because it includes the
evaluation of arguments). The logic of evaluation has general features and
processes that are the same in all of these areas, and in the everyday
business of evaluation, but it also includes some features that are
specific to sub-sets or to individual members of the group. Many of the
standard sub-divisions have had specialists working in them for a lifetime
and have of course evolved sophisticated technical vocabularies and models
of their own. Of course, some of this specialized knowledge will usually
have to be mastered in order to make a contribution to the sub-area,
although the amount varies considerably by area. THE POSSIBILITY OF

While theory is helpful in focusing evaluator's attention and facilitating investigation, it also excludes evidence that does not fit within its framework. The argument is that evaluators need to be aware of all theories that may impinge upon a programme and to defend the theory of choice. They also need to be explicit about what may be excluded from their investigation. Governments aim at change at a macro-level, often using macro-theory, whereas evaluators often concerned with the implementation of programmes may use theory that is at a different, usually the micro-level. Theories at these two levels are not always compatible. The article briefly outlines the development of the theory-driven approach before focusing upon evaluation in health promotion as a case study to highlight the issues.},

Building on a nascent literature, I argue theory diagrams may operate not only conjunctively but also disjunctively, independent from empirics; that their theoretical value lies not only in capturing sociological problems but also in the inferential procedures they embody; that their creative use spans not only deduction and abduction but also induction; that abduction may be pursued with diagrams not only in conjunction with deduction or in the production of visual sketches but also in visual exercises in theoretical play geared primarily toward getting new ideas; and that theory visuals often feature metaphorical aspects that, like their linguistic cousins, transfer thought patterns from one domain to another, thereby providing a major avenue for visual theoretical creativity. Taken together, pursuing these lines of thought helps to build a better understanding of how visualization contributes to the creative intellectual practice of sociological theorizing.},

People living in slum communities have high rates of SMDs, limited access to mental health services and conditions of chronic hardship. Help is commonly sought from faith-based and traditional healers, but people with SMDs require medical treatment, support and follow-up. This multicentre, international mental health mixed-methods research project will (a) conduct community-based ethnographic assessment using participatory methods to explore community understandings of SMDs and help-seeking; (b) explore the role of traditional and faith-based healing for SMDs, from the perspectives of people with SMDs, caregivers, community members, healers, community health workers (CHWs) and health professionals; (c) co-design, with CHWs and healers, training packages for screening, early detection and referral to mental health services; and (d) implement and evaluate the training packages for clinical and cost-effectiveness in improving access to treatment for those with SMDs. TRANSFORM will develop and test a sustainable intervention that can be integrated into existing clinical care and inform priorities for healthcare providers and policy makers.},

It improves on the familiar "critical juncture" framework by specifying the precise causal or noncausal status of the "antecedent conditions" preceding critical junctures. After disaggregating antecedent conditions into four logical types, the authors argue that scholars should be especially mindful of critical antecedents: factors or conditions preceding a critical juncture that combine in a causal sequence with factors operating during that juncture to produce divergent outcomes. Through analytic reviews of a wide array of major works, the authors illustrate how critical antecedents can clarify causal claims and enhance knowledge accumulation in comparative politics. \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2010.},

Therefore, this article opts for an expressivistic semantics for conditionals, grounds this semantics in the arguably most adequate account of conditional belief, that is, ranking theory, and dismisses probability theory for that purpose, because probabilities cannot represent belief. Various expressive options are then explained in terms of ranking theory, with the intention to set out a general interpretive scheme that is able to account for the most variegated usage of conditionals. The Ramsey test is only the first option. Relevance is another, familiar, but little understood item, which comes in several versions. This article adds a further family of expressive options, which is able to subsume also counterfactuals and causal conditionals, and indicates at the end how this family allows for partial recovery of truth conditions for conditionals.},

In this study, we explore if ``concept-mapping'' could be used as a case for constructive alignment of both the process and the outcome of learning. Specifically, we have studied how a simple measure of looking at the order in which concept map elements-concepts (cards, C), links (arrows, A), and linking phrases (phrases, P)- are placed on the working space reveals information about the quality of the final generated map. We report findings from analysis of the concept-mapping process in two separate groups of university students (N = 38 (18 + 20)) who were asked, individually, to build concept maps related to two separate concepts in biology and chemistry respectively. We found that, across both groups, students consistently followed the same order of element placement that they began with and found significant differences in the quality of eventual maps resulting from students' map building strategies. Our results suggest that the quality of students' concept maps depends considerably on the strategy used to build it, and point to the supplementary role that the physical working space of the concept-mapping exercise offers to students' own working memory as a possible explanation for these quality differences.},

In this article, we propose a robust methodology for detecting the latent and elusive structure of dynamic complex systems. Our treatment utilizes short-term predictions from information embedded in reconstructed state space. In this regard, using a broad class of real-world applications from ecology, neurology, and finance, we explore and are able to demonstrate our method's power and accuracy to reconstruct the fundamental structure of these complex systems, and simultaneously highlight their most fundamental operations.},

We identify four main purposes of ToC \textendash{} strategic planning, description, monitoring and evaluation and learning \textendash{} although these inevitably overlap. For this reason, we have adopted the term `ToC approaches' to identify the range of applications associated with this term. Additionally, we identify some confusion in the terminology associated with ToC. Of particular note is the lack of clarity surrounding the use of the terms `assumption' and `evidence'. Finally, we have also drawn out information on what authors feel makes for ToC `best practice' in terms of both content and process, alongside an exploration of the remaining gaps where more clarity is needed.}

  abstract = {We use a newly developed technique that is based on the information flow concept to investigate the causal structure between the global radiative forcing and the annual global mean surface temperature anomalies (GMTA) since 1850. Our study unambiguously shows one-way causality between the total Greenhouse Gases and GMTA. Specifically, it is confirmed that the former, especially CO2, are the main causal drivers of the recent warming. A significant but smaller information flow comes from aerosol direct and indirect forcing, and on short time periods, volcanic forcings. In contrast the causality contribution from natural forcings (solar irradiance and volcanic forcing) to the long term trend is not significant. The spatial explicit analysis reveals that the anthropogenic forcing fingerprint is significantly regionally varying in both hemispheres. On paleoclimate time scales, however, the cause-effect direction is reversed: temperature changes cause subsequent CO2/CH4 changes.}

Most prior work has either focused on the generation of concept maps for small corpora or require expensive training data to implement. In this work, we focus on generating causal maps, a subset of concept maps in which only semantically causal relationships are considered. We propose a map generation framework which utilizes a novel mixture model to simultaneously derive concepts and links. This method is computationally efficient and therefore scalable to large datasets, and is fully unsupervised, which makes it suitable for practical applications. We show that our method performs better than a commonly used unsupervised text summarization algorithm, and has results which are comparable to the state-of-the-art supervised method.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:A growing body of literature has demonstrated that higher social capital is associated with improved health conditions. However, some research indicated that the association between social capital and health was substantially attenuated after adjustment for material deprivation. Studies exploring the association between poverty, social capital and health still have some serious limitations. In China, health equity studies focusing on urban poor are scarce. The purpose of this study is therefore to examine how poverty and individual-level social capital in urban China are associated with health equity.METHODS:Our study is based on a household study sample consisting of 1605 participants in two Chinese cities. For all participants, data on personal characteristics, health status, health care utilisation and social capital were collected. Factor analysis was performed to extract social capital factors. Dichotomised social capital factors were used for logistic regression models. A synergy index (if it is above 1, we can know the existence of the co-operative effect) was computed to examine the interaction effect between lack of social capital and poverty.RESULTS:Results indicated the poor had an obviously higher probability of belonging to the low individual-level social capital group in all the five dimensions, with the adjusted odds ratios ranging from 1.42 to 2.12. When the other variables were controlled for in the total sample, neighbourhood cohesion (NC), and reciprocity and social support (RSS) were statistically associated with poor self-rated health (NC: OR = 1.40; RSS: OR = 1.34). However, for the non-poor sub-sample, no social capital variable was a statistically significant predictor. The synergy index between low individual-level NC and poverty, and between low individual-level RSS and poverty were 1.22 and 1.28, respectively, indicating an aggravating effect between them.CONCLUSION:In this study, we have shown that the interaction effect between poverty and lack of social capital (NC and RSS) was a good predictor of poor SRH in urban China. Improving NC and RSS may be helpful in reducing health inequity; however, poverty reduction is more important and therefore should be implemented at the same time. Policies that attempt to improve health equity via social capital, but neglect poverty intervention, would be counter-productive.},

  abstract = {Background: Social media offer an unprecedented opportunity to explore how people talk about health care at a very large scale. Numerous studies have shown the importance of websites with user forums for people seeking information related to health. Parents turn to some of these sites, colloquially referred to as ``mommy blogs,'' to share concerns about children's health care, including vaccination. Although substantial work has considered the role of social media, particularly Twitter, in discussions of vaccination and other health care\textendash related issues, there has been little work on describing the underlying structure of these discussions and the role of persuasive storytelling, particularly on sites with no limits on post length. Understanding the role of persuasive storytelling at Internet scale provides useful insight into how people discuss vaccinations, including exemption-seeking behavior, which has been tied to a recent diminution of herd immunity in some communities. Objective: To develop an automated and scalable machine-learning method for story aggregation on social media sites dedicated to discussions of parenting. We wanted to discover the aggregate narrative frameworks to which individuals, through their exchange of experiences and commentary, contribute over time in a particular topic domain. We also wanted to characterize temporal trends in these narrative frameworks on the sites over the study period. Methods: To ensure that our data capture long-term discussions and not short-term reactions to recent events, we developed a dataset of 1.99 million posts contributed by 40,056 users and viewed 20.12 million times indexed from 2 parenting sites over a period of 105 months. Using probabilistic methods, we determined the topics of discussion on these parenting sites. We developed a generative statistical-mechanical narrative model to automatically extract the underlying stories and story fragments from millions of posts. We aggregated the stories into an overarching narrative framework graph. In our model, stories were represented as network graphs with actants as nodes and their various relationships as edges. We estimated the latent stories circulating on these sites by modeling the posts as a sampling of the hidden narrative framework graph. Temporal trends were examined based on monthly user-poststatistics. Results: We discovered that discussions of exemption from vaccination requirements are highly represented. We found a strong narrative framework related to exemption seeking and a culture of distrust of government and medical institutions. Various posts reinforced part of the narrative framework graph in which parents, medical professionals, and religious institutions emerged as key nodes, and exemption seeking emerged as an important edge. In the aggregate story, parents used religion or belief to acquire exemptions to protect their children from vaccines that are required by schools or government institutions, but (allegedly) cause adverse reactions such as autism, pain, compromised immunity, and even death. Although parents joined and left the discussion forums over time, discussions and stories about exemptions were persistent and robust to these membership changes. Conclusions: Analyzing parent forums about health care using an automated analytic approach, such as the one presented here, allows the detection of widespread narrative frameworks that structure and inform discussions. In most vaccination stories from the sites we analyzed, it is taken for granted that vaccines and not vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs) pose a threat to children. Because vaccines are seen as a threat, parents focus on sharing successful strategies for avoiding them, with exemption being the foremost among these strategies. When new parents join such sites, they may be exposed to this endemic narrative framework in the threads they read and to which they contribute, which may influence their health care decision making.},

Research suggests that OVC programs enhance household- and child-level resilience to economic, environmental, social, or political shocks, but there is little evidence elucidating the pathways by which intervention components, including economic strengthening and social protection programs, affect these outcomes. This case study uses exploratory qualitative research to generate a causal model for the Community Care Program (CCP) in Mozambique. We used the Most Significant Change methodology to compile mini-case studies and identify primary causal pathways between program components and outcomes. We also used the Community Capitals Framework to explore how CCP affected community-level resilience. Our findings suggest that CCP's multicomponent approach generated mutually reinforcing drivers that enhanced child-, household-, and community-level resilience. CCP's effects on stigma reduction, increased social support, and economic status were also vital.}

  abstract = {The paper addresses the challenges of evaluating the impact of business coaching programmes with a varied portfolio of firms working across sectors and countries. Observable indicators of changes in business management practices are rarely relevant across sectors. Therefore, evaluators need to rely on the perceptions of the managers who have received coaching. We designed an online survey to compare the effectiveness of business coaching within a portfolio and across programmes. The survey was applied to the portfolio of two private sector development programmes. We derived so-called `contribution scores' from individuals' perceptions of how business management practices had changed and their perceptions of the role of business coaching in bringing about these changes. The survey included some features to reflect on response reliability. We show that the tool seems fairly reliable for comparative analysis and helped to identify the types of firms and contexts where business coaching support appears more effective.},

  abstract = {Politics has in recent decades entered an era of intense polarization. Explanations have implicated digital media, with the so-called echo chamber remaining a dominant causal hypothesis despite growing challenge by empirical evidence. This paper suggests that this mounting evidence provides not only reason to reject the echo chamber hypothesis but also the foundation for an alternative causal mechanism. To propose such a mechanism, the paper draws on the literatures on affective polarization, digital media, and opinion dynamics. From the affective polarization literature, we follow the move from seeing polarization as diverging issue positions to rooted in sorting: an alignment of differences which is effectively dividing the electorate into two increasingly homogeneous megaparties. To explain the rise in sorting, the paper draws on opinion dynamics and digital media research to present a model which essentially turns the echo chamber on its head: it is not isolation from opposing views that drives polarization but precisely the fact that digital media bring us to interact outside our local bubble. When individuals interact locally, the outcome is a stable plural patchwork of cross-cutting conflicts. By encouraging nonlocal interaction, digital media drive an alignment of conflicts along partisan lines, thus effacing the counterbalancing effects of local heterogeneity. The result is polarization, even if individual interaction leads to convergence. The model thus suggests that digital media polarize through partisan sorting, creating a maelstrom in which more and more identities, beliefs, and cultural preferences become drawn into an all-encompassing societal division.},

MTurk is a marketplace for discrete tasks completed by workers, typically for small amounts of money. MTurk has been used to aid psychological research in general, and content analysis in particular. In the current study, MTurk workers content analyzed personally-written textual data using coding categories previously developed and validated in psychological research. These codes were evaluated for reliability, accuracy, completion time, and cost. Results indicate that MTurk workers categorized textual data with comparable reliability and accuracy to both previously published studies and expert raters. Further, the coding tasks were performed quickly and cheaply. These data suggest that crowdsourced content analysis can help advance psychological research.},

In the process the author will review the selected literature so that they can be linked together for further consideration and development. When monthly and daily data for S\&P 500, DJIA, and NASDAQ indexes were analyzed from 1971 to 2005, the author found long string of positive and significant autocorrelations and great volatility, which were not consistent with the efficient market hypothesis. The international market indexes from Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Mexico, Taiwan, and Canada are also very volatile even though they show less volatility compared to the U.S. indexes. Since AMH was introduced in 2004, it is promising but is still at its infant stage of development. Finally, the neural/medical finance can help us understand the brain activities when investors are making investing and trading decisions, and the effect of drugs on brain and investment decision-making. The future of neurofinance and AMH appears to be promising.},

Sequential regression analysis was performed with age, gender, tsunami experiences, and family functioning predicting youth behavior problems. In-depth interviews with 40 adolescents revealed many losses and difficulties after the tsunami, including death of parents and school difficulties. Positive aspects of recovery were support from family, peers, and other social networks and increased educational opportunities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved)},

Traditionally, research and practice have operated in independent spheres with practitioners focused on the implementation of programs that affect individual behavior and researchers focused on the development and testing of theory. Evidence-based practice (EBP), practice-based evidence, and translational research have attempted to unite these worlds, and although significant advances have been made, there is a continued need to find mechanisms that enable a seamless connection between knowledge generation and application. We propose a method that builds on the traditions of theory-driven evaluation, logic modeling, and systems science and uses evaluation and program planning as the bridging mechanism between research and practice. Included in this approach are methods that aid in the explicit expression of implicit theories, management of evaluation resources, and linkage of program theory and evaluation measures to a research evidence base. \textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2009.},

It represents a significant mind-set shift for the evaluation field and it is a powerful tool to tackle complex environments. Heir to the systems concepts of the engineering field, and especially regarding the hard systems tools, ST in evaluation uses the same visual tools that were created many years ago. All these tools already incorporate data visualization features: they depict ideas, relationships and concepts relying in shapes and figures more than a textual explanation. Revisiting these tools and applying the latest data visualization principles, they could be optimised in order to provide with more information within the same concept. Purpose: To provide ST practitioners with more informative tools in order to facilitate: - ST experts and users can optimise the application of the tools to real life models beyond the initial set up of their visual representations. - Audiences of evaluations using ST as part of the toolkit can find the outputs more apprehensible and easy to understand . Setting: Not applicable. Intervention: Not applicable. Research Design: Not applicable. Data Collection and Analysis: Not applicable. Findings: Improving ST representations of reality and systems can help both enhance ST applications and make it more accessible and comprehensible for evaluation practitioners' and users. Six ways for improving the understanding of the current stock and flow diagrams were identified. The tools proposed consist of: customizing the colours and shape of the variables and their relationships to make them more informative; highlighting the existing subsystems within the model; and providing the specific sequence for reading the main causal chains.}

The current debates on Nudge theory are often highly normative or ideologically driven and pay limited attention to more practical aspects of the theory. Is nudging evaluable as a theory and a practice, and if so how? Is there solid evidence available of nudge success over other governance interventions? What is to be considered a nudge success? What data and evaluative techniques may assist in evaluating nudging beyond individual cases? The current article seeks to explore these questions.},

The approach centres on practical judgment and the construction and examination of stories through interaction between advocates and monitoring and evaluation specialists. The article discusses how Narrative Assessment can be useful in the evaluation of advocacy in terms of (1) monitoring and evaluation specialists' orientation toward programmes; (2) the interpretation of outcomes; (3) the assessment of outcome relevance; (4) reflection and learning and (5) the communication of programme results. The approach builds on lessons drawn from evaluation of eight advocacy programmes in international development.}

However, studies on management of volunteers are scarce and current research on human resource management of volunteers faces methodological challenges. This paper presents the protocol of a realist evaluation that aims at identifying the factors influencing the performance of community health volunteers involved in the delivery of a Red Cross immunisation programme in Kampala (Uganda) with a specific focus on motivation.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: The realist evaluation cycle structures the protocol. To develop the theoretical basis for the evaluation, the authors conducted interviews and reviewed the literature on community health volunteers' performance, management and organisational behaviour. This led to the formulation of the initial programme theory, which links the intervention inputs (capacity-building strategies) to the expected outcomes (positive work behaviour) with mechanisms that point in the direction of drivers of motivation. The contextual elements include components such as organisational culture, resource availability, etc. A case study design will be adopted. We define a case as a Red Cross branch, run by a programme manager, and will select two cases at the district level in Kampala. Mixed methods will be used in data collection, including individual interviews of volunteers, participant observation and document review. The thematic analysis will be based on the initial programme theory and will seek for context-mechanism-outcome configurations. Findings from the two cases will be compared.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nDISCUSSION: We discuss the scope for applying realist evaluation and the methodological challenges we encountered in developing this protocol.\$\textbackslash backslash\$n\$\textbackslash backslash\$nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the Ethical Committee at Rennes University Hospital, France. Results will be published in scientific journals, and communicated to respondents and relevant institutions.}

"Introduction
In the looking glass world of development,1 pessimism reigns, and things
always fall apart. Dysfunctionality, collapse, disaster, poverty, famine,
violence, and exploitation are not words used to signify the
extraordinary, but are the normal vocabulary of everyday business. Many of
the widely available texts on the subject present themselves as analytics
of failure. The title of Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson's book is Why
Nations Fail. James Scott's seminal book Seeing Like A State has the
sub-title How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition have Failed".
Paul Collier's Bottom Billion is similarly about Why the Poorest Countries
are Failing. Dambisa Moyo's book on Dead Aid is about Why Aid is not
Working. Bill Easterly's book on the White Man's Burden is about Why the
West's Efforts to Aid the Rest have done so much Ill" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D7Z2Y95B?page=1}{Venugopal

"Negativity forms the everyday mood music in an
environment where people are required to adopt a certain posture of

"Easterly (2009) for example, argues that the design of
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and their unachievable targets
rendered what were actually impressive successes in Africa to be
categorised as demoralising failures. Similarly, Kumar and Corbridge
(2002) argue that DFID's Eastern India Rainfed Farming Project (EIRFP)
actually succeeded in many economic measures, but was declared a failure
because it did not meet criteria that, even its planners would probably
agree, were impossible to meet" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/D7Z2Y95B?page=2}{Venugopal

It introduces the ``completeness standard,'' which combines causal graphs, event history maps, and invariant causal mechanisms. The completeness standard, it argues, bridges unitlevel causal inferences and average treatment effects, invokes an epistemologically warranted conceptualization of causation, and better satisfies existing standards of causal inference by making unit homogeneity assumptions more credible.},

While literature has shown positive patient, health care provider, and system benefits (SDM outputs), further research is required to understand the nuances of this type of decision-making. As such, we set out to address: "In which situations, how, why, and for whom does SDM between patients and health care providers contribute to improved engagement in the Shared Decision-making process?" Methods: To achieve our study goals we conducted a seven-step realist synthesis process, which included: (1) preliminary program theory development, (2) search strategy development, (3) selection and appraisal of literature in accordance with realist methodology, (4) data extraction, (5) identification of relevant formal theories, (6) data analysis and synthesis, and (7) formation of a revised program theory with the input of stakeholders. This process was done in accordance with RAMESES guidelines and publication standards for a realist synthesis. Expert consultations were also held to ensure consistency within the SDM literature. Results: Through our realist synthesis, we developed a program theory of SDM which includes three contexts (pre-existing relationship, difficulty of decision, and system support), eight mechanism sets (anxiety, trust, perception of other party capacity, perception of time, self-efficacy, world view, perception of capacity to external support, and recognition of decision), and one outcome (engagement in SDM). Conclusions: As far as the authors of this paper are aware, this paper is the first to begin unpacking how SDM works, for whom, in which circumstances, and why. By examining key mechanism sets and exploring how they facilitate or inhibit SDM, we have produced a program theory that may assist health care professionals, policy makers, and patients. While further research is suggested to further unpack the concepts identified within this paper, this provides an initial understanding into the theory behind SDM.

This paper aims to provide a new explanation of why we have failed and what must be done to improve our understanding, decision-making, action and success. Design/methodology/approach: Integrative propositional analysis is used to evaluate and synthesize theoretical and practical perspectives on poverty from five academic disciplines and five disparate organizations. Findings: Individual theoretical perspectives were found to have low levels of complexity and systemicity. Research limitations/implications: Clear research directions are shown to accelerate improvements in understanding. Additionally, results may provide a useful guide for developing computer models of poverty. Practical implications: The causal knowledge map of synthesized theories suggests where practice may be relatively effective and where unanticipated consequences are more likely to occur. Social implications: Policy decision-making to address the problem of poverty is not likely to lead to successful resolution. Thus, poverty is likely to continue until we develop a more systemic understanding. Originality/value: This interdisciplinary paper provides a new structural perspective on why we have not been able to solve the poverty problem \textendash{} and shows how far we have yet to go to reach success.},

  abstract = {STRATEGIC KNOWLEDGE MAPPING: THE CO-CREATION OF USEFUL KNOWLEDGE Steven E. Wallis, Bernadette Wright ABSTRACT Strategic planning typically involves conducting research and setting objectives. It is a difficult and expensive process with no guarantee of success. Recent research shows that managers with more ``structured'' knowledge will be more successful. Using Integrative Propositional Analysis (IPA) we can objectively determine the potential usefulness of a Strategic Knowledge Map (SKM). Creating an effective SKM is a precursor to more easily creating a more effective strategic plan. The present game is focused on players co-creating an SKM. Their play is scored in such a way that they will receive more points for creating a more structured map. The resulting map may be easily used in the ``real world'' to support dialog, decision making, and the creation of specific objectives for strategic plans. The game is unorthodox. It is not a simulation where play begins with a pre-set ``world.'' Similarly, the game is not educational in the traditional sense where players attempt to acquire or test knowledge using an existing database. Instead, ASK MATT is a model-building game where knowledge is co-created within the game by the players. Further, the game goes beyond finding ``insights;'' instead, the results of the game may be directly applied as a guide to real world situations. In the present paper, we explore the background, difficulties, and opportunities for improving strategic planning and policy planning using strategic knowledge mapping from a systemic perspective. We explain the play of the game, its scoring, anticipated outcomes, our experiences playtesting the game with small groups, plans for playtesting with larger groups, and opportunities for developing a version of the game that may be played online and/or as an APP.},

We find a horizontal dimension (represented by causal connections between concepts at one ontological level) and a vertical dimension (represented by connections of emergence between concepts of differing ontological levels). This view of emergence offers a new way to structurally distinguish between conceptual components of a theory, thus supporting a new approach to building theories that better reflects our systemic world. A third, perspectival, approach may be applied to aid in the understanding of both dimensions. A typology is proposed as are conventions for diagramming theories and new criteria for improving the structure of theories.},

  abstract = {A bipolar fuzzy set theory is presented for cognitive modeling and multiagent decision analysis. Firstly, notions of bipolar fuzziness are introduced. Secondly an interval-based bipolar fuzzy logic is defined which generalizes a real-valued bipolar fuzzy logic by allowing interval-based linguistic variables x and y to be substituted into (S,=,V,@) or ( S , = , U , O ) where S = \{v(x,y)l(x,y) + E ([-1 ,O]x [0, l])\}. Thirdly, a fuzzy number-based bipolar logic is presented which further generalizes the intervalbased model by allowing a-level fuzzy number-based linguistic variables x and y to be substituted into (S, =, v , @I 0 r ( S , = , U , O ) , s = \{v(x,Y)I(x,Y)maPs (L-l,OIX[O,11) to [O,l]\}. Bipolar fuzzy set operations of disjunctioncomposition (v -@), union-composition ( U - 0 ) , are proved commutative and associative; v respect to \texteuro 3 and U respect to 0 are proved distributive. It is shown that a intervalbased bipolar variable is a nesting of a real-valued bipolar variable; a trapezoidal-fuzzy nuniber-based bipolar variable is a 2-level nesting of an interval-based bipolar variable; and an a-level (a is an integer) fuzzy number-based bipolar variable is an a +1 level nesting of an interval-based bipolar variable. Based on the nesting features, it is proved that alevel fuzzy number-based bipolar operations can be cowerted to interval-based and then real-valued bipolar operations. The conversions lead to significant computational simplifications on bipolar fuzzy relations. Major advantages of the bipolar fuzzy set theory include: 1) it formalizes a unified approach to polarity and fuzziness; 2) it captures the bipolar or double-sided (negative and positive, or effect and side effect) nature of human perception and cognition; and 3) it provides a basis for bipolar cognitive modeling and multiagent decision analysis.},

Because of their similarities and differences, evaluators can usefully draw on both perspectives within the same evaluation. One way to do so is to draw on key concepts from each in the selection and use of substantive theory. The article introduces the concept of `complexity-consistent' substantive theories and suggests that this is useful for the evaluation of policies and programs in complex adaptive systems. It demonstrates how substantive theories can be analysed in complexity terms, how multiple theories can be `layered' to reflect multiple levels of systems, and how such theories can be used within evaluation design and analysis.},

There is no point in methodological debates unless they agree a common starting point. Second, I argue that there is confusion between counterfactuals, which are implied by the definition of impact evaluation adopted in this paper, and control groups, which are not always necessary to construct a counterfactual. Third, I address contribution rather than attribution \textemdash{} a distinction that is also definitional, mistaking claims of attribution to mean sole attribution. I then consider accusations of being `positivist' and `linear', which are, respectively, correct and unclear. Finally, I suggest that these arguments do not mean that there is a hierarchy of methods, rather quantitative approaches, including RCTs, are often the most appropriate methods for evaluating the impact of a large range of interventions, having the added advantage of allowing analysis of cost effectiveness or cost-benefit analysis.},

the issue of attribution by identifying the counterfactual value of Y
(Y0'' (White, 2010, p. 154)
\par
``With
that point in mind we can focus on a more precise question, which is must
`scientifically valid' methods of experimental and quasi-experimental
methods be used to attribute observed changes to a specific intervention?
Note that this wording is intended to make it very clear that there are
many evaluation questions for which other methodological approaches are
more appropriate. I'' (White, 2010, p. 155)
\par
``For
small, and often middle size, n then qualitative approaches are the best
available methodology, such as the fuzzy set social science approaches
discussed by Ragin (2000);'' (White, 2010, p. 155)
\par
``a
review by 3ie of the `evaluative reports database' of the Active Learning
Network for Accountability and Performance in Humanitarian Action (ALNAP)
showed that not one of the 339 evaluation studies could be classified as a
rigorous impact evaluation'' (White, 2010, p. 156)
\par
``as
critics correctly point out, even randomization may not do the trick
(Deaton, 2009; Scriven, 2008).'' (White, 2010, p. 156)
\par
``Rigorous
impact evaluation is a building block, a necessary component, of a
good-quality impact evaluation, but it is not all there is to it.''
(White, 2010, p. 156)
\par
``Cost-benefit
analysis was explicitly based on with versus without analysis; that is,
establishment of a counterfactual of what outcomes would have been in the
absence of the project. This counterfactual was commonly generated through
use of a comparison group \textendash{} what recent developments do is give more
robust estimates of these benefits.'' (White, 2010, p. 156)
\par
``Cost-benefit
analysis fell into general disuse in the 1980s and early 1990s as a result
of two related trends (see White, 2005, for more discussion).''
(White, 2010, p. 156)
\par
``In
the remainder of this article I am addressing impact evaluations whose
explicit purpose is an analysis of attribution. I have noted already that
this is just one definition of impact evaluation and that the other
definition is not wrong, but different, and that that other definition
opens the door to alternative methodologies. But I do subscribe to the
view that there is a need for a greater number of quality studies
addressing attribution using quantitative methods.'' (White, 2010, p. 157)
\par
``The
impact question is how much of that 12 percent can be attributed to the
project? Even if the outcome is dichotomous, (i.e. an outcome happens or
it does not) then the impact question is how the intervention affected the
probability of the event occurring, which is indeed what the impact on the
mortality rate tells us for any given infant.'' (White, 2010, p. 159)
\par
``This
use of `contribution analysis' is not the same as Mayne's `contribution
analysis'.'' (White, 2010, p. 159)
\par
``Mayne
is clear that this method is not an approach to impact evaluation. It is
an evaluation tool which will serve some purposes, but quantifying impact,
in the sense used here, is not one of them. He states explicitly that `an
[impact] evaluation study probably remains the best way to address [the
attribution] problem, if one has the time, money and expertise'
(2001).'' (White, 2010, p. 159)
\par
``This
same argument also addresses some of the more philosophical objections
regarding causation. Suppose both A and B are, individually, sufficient to
cause C, but just one of them is necessary (the problem of
over-determination). H'' (White, 2010, p. 160)
\par
``But
the outcome of interest usually varies over a range for example, enrolment
or mortality rates. In this case both A and B can contribute to changes in
C.'' (White, 2010, p. 160)
\par
``Quantitative
impact evaluation can also make more complex causal inferences regarding
context. Context is one aspect of impact heterogeneity.'' (White, 2010, p. 160)
\par
``implies
a linear relationship,'' (White, 2010, p. 160)
\par
``An
alternative criticism of linear appears to refer to one-way causation.
That is, quantitative impact evaluation assumes that X affects Y without
allowing for the fact that Y may also affect X. Such a critique is
patently false,'' (White, 2010, p. 160)
\par
``The
accusation `linear' also appears to mean that models of the causal chain
imply an automatic (or deterministic) relationship. T'' (White, 2010, p. 160)
\par
``Another
interpretation of linear is that it misses the multiple causal pathways
which occur in real interventions. A'' (White, 2010, p. 161)
\par
``A
further, and related, use of linear in fact refers to single-equation
modelling of a multiequation system, summed up as `it's all terribly
complex', or more formally as `these approaches may be all very well for
very simple interventions, but they can't be used for the more complex
interventions of the sort commonly implemented today'. This statement
needs to be understood to respond to it.'' (White, 2010, p. 161)
\par
``This
leaves us with the problem of emergent outcomes. We may not know what the
outcomes of an intervention will be in advance: what the outcomes will be
can only be discovered as the intervention proceeds. I deal with this
question in part by turning to the charge that impact evaluation is
undemocratic.'' (White, 2010, p. 161)}

It is widely accepted that a theory - based approach to impact evaluation, one that maps out the causal chain from inputs to outcomes and impact and tests the underlying assumptions, will shed light on the why question. But application of a theory-based approach remains weak. This paper identifies the following six principles to successful application of the approach: (1) map out the causal chain (programme theory); (2) understand context; (3) anticipate heterogeneity; (4) rigorous evaluation of impact using a credible counterfactual; (5) rigorous factual analysis; and (6) use mixed methods.},

the logic of establishing causality" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NVR3Q7DJ?page=3}{Williamson

"Henceforth, we will primarily be interested in generic
claims (repeatably instantiatable or'type-level' claims, such as the claim
that taking aspirin relieves headache), but RWT may be taken to apply also
to single-case claims ('token-level' claims, such as the claim that Bob's
taking aspirin this morning relieved his headache)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NVR3Q7DJ?page=3}{Williamson

"In the statement of RWT above,'mechanism' can be
understood broadly as referring to a complex-systems mechanism, a
mechanistic process, or some combination of the two. A complex-systems
mechanism consists of entities and activities organised in such a way that
they are responsible for some phenomenon to be explained (Machamer,
Darden, and Craver 2000; Illari and Williamson 2012). An example is the
mechanism by which the heart pumps blood. A mechanistic process is a
spatio-temporally contiguous process along which a signal is propagated
(Reichenbach 1956; Salmon 1998). An" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NVR3Q7DJ?page=3}{Williamson

"Note that a mechanism cannot in general be thought of
simply as a causal network. A causal network can be represented by a
directed graph whose nodes represent events or variables and where there
is an arrow from one node to another if the former is a direct cause of
the latter. On the other hand, a mechanism is typically represented by a
richer diagram, such as is frequently found in textbooks and research
articles in medicine" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NVR3Q7DJ?page=3}{Williamson
2019:35})
\par
"Whether or not establishing is factive, it requires
meeting a high epistemological standard. In particular, establishing a
causal claim should be distinguished from acting in accord with a causal
claim as a precautionary measure: in certain cases in which a proposed
health action has a relatively low cost, or failing to treat has a high
cost, it may be appropriate to initiate the action even when its
effectiveness has not been established, so that benefits can be reaped in
case it turns out to be effective." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NVR3Q7DJ?page=5}{Williamson
2019:37})
\par
"1.4. Correlation The epistemological thesis says that
one needs to establish that the putative cause and effect
are'appropriately correlated'. Here'appropriately correlated' just means
probabilistically dependent conditional on potential confounders, where
the probability distribution in question is relative to a specified
population or reference class of individuals" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NVR3Q7DJ?page=5}{Williamson
2019:37})
\par
"RWT says that one'normally' needs to establish both
correlation and mechanism. This is because there are certain cases in
which causality is apparently not accompanied by a correlation and there
are also cases in which causality is apparently not accompanied by an
underlying mechanism. If this is so, one cannot expect to establish both
correlation and mechanism in these cases" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NVR3Q7DJ?page=6}{Williamson
2019:38})
\par
"Where the cause and/or the effect is an absence, it
cannot be connected by an actual mechanism. In many such cases, one can
expect a counterfactual mechanism. Suppose cause and effect are both
absences: e.g. failing to treat causes a lack of a heartbeat. If things
had been different in such a way that what was absent in the cause were
present (e.g. the treatment is administered), then one would expect a
mechanism from this presence to a presence corresponding to the effect
(e.g. a heartbeat). One might think, then, that one ought to be able to
establish the existence of a counterfactual mechanism for any causal
claim, if not an actual mechanism" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NVR3Q7DJ?page=6}{Williamson

System diagrams provide an excellent way of clarifying complex situations and help to address identified problems. Potential users are spoilt for choice - there are literally dozens of different diagram based approaches.However, there are not many easily accessible publications that describe how to match and use appropriate diagrams to particular tasks. Which is why System Diagrams; A Practical Guide came to be written.The discussion of each approach is accompanied by a worked example and a set of questions that that the diagram addresses. There are also chapters on the role of diagrams in general; what constitutes a systemic inquiry and the overall nature of system diagrams.System Diagrams; A Practical Guide covers six diagram approaches that between them cover a wide range of uses;Rich Picturing. Useful when trying to get to grips with the complexity of a situation and work out which aspects you should be focusing on.Influence Diagrams. Useful when you want to have a snapshot of what is influencing a particular issue or topic at a particular moment in time.Causal Diagrams. Useful when you want to explore the possible consequences of specific causal relationships within a particular issue or topic over a period of time.Cynefin. A diagram that helps you to think about and respond to a particular situation, or intervention, through five different framings; simple, complicated, complex, chaotic and confused.Viable System Model (VSM).

Many more lives are lost in violent conflict and to the preventable outcome of disease and hunger (see Tables 1.1 and 1.2).2" (Wisner et al 2004:13)"e" (Wisner et al 2004:14)"However, we feel this book is justified, despite this rather artificial separation between people at risk from natural hazards and the many dangers inherent in 'normal' life." (Wisner et al 2004:14)"The crucial point about understanding why disasters happen is that it is not only natural events that cause them. They are also the product of social, political and economic environments (as distinct from the natural environment), because of the way these structure the lives of different groups of people (see Box 1.1)." (Wisner et al 2004:14)"These two aspects \textendash{} the natural and the social \textendash{} cannot be separated from each other:" (Wisner et al 2004:15)"especially in LDCs, vulnerable people often suffer repeated, multiple, mutually reinforcing, and sometimes simultaneous shocks to their families," (Wisner et al 2004:15)"The 1990s was the UN International Decade of Natural Disaster Reduction" (Wisner et al 2004:16)"This book is focused mainly on redressing the balance in assessing the 'causes' of such disasters away from the dominant view that natural processes are the most significant." (Wisner et al 2004:17)great diagram (note on p.18)"In Guatemala, after the 1976 earthquake, the situation deteriorated, with years of civil war and genocide against the rural Mayan majority that only ended in 1996. During this period, hundreds of thousands of Mayans were herded into new settlements by government soldiers, while others took refuge in remote, forested mountains and still others fled to refugee camps in Mexico. These population movements often saw marginal people forced into marginal, dangerous places." (Wisner et al 2004:19)"1970s and early 1980s, the vulnerability approach to disasters began with a rejection of the assumption that disasters are 'caused' in any simple way by external natural events," (Wisner et al 2004:20)"A competing vulnerability framework arose from the experience of research in situations where 'normal' daily life was itself difficult to distinguish from disaster." (Wisner et al 2004:20)"One approach was unapologetically naturalist" (Wisner et al 2004:20)"Other views of 'man [sic] and nature' (e.g. Burton et al. 1978; Whittow 1980) involved a more subtle environmental determinism," (Wisner et al 2004:20)"It was assumed that 'progress' and 'modernisation' were taking place, and that 'folk' and 'mixed' societies would become 'industrial'," (Wisner et al 2004:21)"The 1970s saw increasing attempts to use 'political economy' to counter modernisation theory and its triumphalist outlook" (Wisner et al 2004:21)"We avoid notions of vulnerability that do no more than identify it with 'poverty'" (Wisner et al 2004:21)"We also reject those definitions of vulnerability that focus exclusively on the ability of a system to cope with risk or loss.12" (Wisner et al 2004:21)"By vulnerability we mean the characteristics of a person or group and their situation that influence their capacity to anticipate, cope with, resist and recover from the impact of a natural hazard (an extreme natural event or process)" (Wisner et al 2004:21)"When used in this sense, the implied opposite of being vulnerable is sometimes indicated by our use of the term 'secure'.13 Other authors complement the discussions of vulnerability with the notion of 'capacity'" (Wisner et al 2004:22)"vulnerability has a time dimension built into it: vulnerability can be measured in terms of the damage to future livelihoods, and not just as what happens to life and property at the time of the hazard event."

We mean by this the command an individual, family or other social group has over an income and/or bundles of resources that can be used or exchanged to satisfy its needs."

(Wisner et al 2004:22)"There are three important differences, however , between the vulnerability of the rich and the poor in such cases" (Wisner et al 2004:22)"Firstly, few rich people are affected if we compare the number of victims of landslides in various cities around the world." (Wisner et al 2004:22)"Secondly, living in the hazardous canyon environment is a choice made by some of the rich in California, but not by the poor Brazilian or Philippine job seekers" (Wisner et al 2004:23)"Thirdly, the consequences of a landslide for the rich are far less severe than for the surviving poor."

Disaster impact is measured by a range of etic (external) and objectively verifiable indicators, such as mortality, morbidity, damage to property and physical assets, reduction in savings and so on." (Wisner et al 2004:24)"these indicators are not sufficient, and we are aware that they tend to under-emphasise the cultural, the psychosomatic and subjective aspects of disaster impact" (Wisner et al 2004:24)"drawing down of different 'capitals' and the conversion of one to another" (Wisner et al 2004:25)"offers a more holistic view of well-being and decision making, particularly under conditions of 'normal' life, and this is a contemporary development of disaster theory which we elaborate on at length in Chapter 3." (Wisner et al 2004:25)"However , even this approach tends to make many untested and simplistic assumptions about preferences, choices and values, particularly under conditions of acute stress and extraordinary circumstances." (Wisner et al 2004:25)"Fourthly, overlapping with the previous point, there is a movement away from simple taxonomies or checklists of 'vulnerable groups' to a concern with 'vulnerable situations', which people move into and out of over time." (Wisner et al 2004:25)"'Vulnerability', as we use the word, refers only to people, not to buildings (susceptible, unsafe), economies (fragile), nor unstable slopes (hazardous) or regions of the earth's surface (hazard-prone)." (Wisner et al 2004:25)"Special interest non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have produced detailed checklists to take account of the particular needs and vulnerabilities of such groups as elderly people or unaccompanied children, both in vulnerability/capacity assessments as well as post-disaster needs assessments (see Chapter 9). These post-disaster tools are very useful as aides m\'emoires for busy administrators and case workers" (Wisner et al 2004:25)"But the use of post-disaster checklists does not in itself help one to understand why and how those characteristics have come to be associated with a higher probability of injury, death, livelihood disruption and greater difficulty in recovery" (Wisner et al 2004:25)However, the empirical discoveryof an association or correlation does not explain the process that gave rise to the association xi realist{$\Exclam$}!

(Wisner et al 2004:26)"There is a large and growing literature on risk that we acknowledge but do not directly engage with in this book. The main reason is that it focuses primarily on technological hazards" (Wisner et al 2004:26)"One influential author writing about risk during the 1980s and 1990s is Ulrich Beck. His books Risk Society: Toward a New Modernity? (1992) and Ecological Politics in the Age of Risk (1995)," (Wisner et al 2004:26)"Beck maintains that the more developed world is in a transitional state between industrial society and 'risk society': with so much wealth also come risks." (Wisner et al 2004:27)"Thus, industrial, affluent society is increasingly protected against the uncertainties faced in LDCs through the application of technology and higher levels of income. Yet it is none the less increasingly preoccupied with incalculable and diffuse risks," (Wisner et al 2004:27)"use of Beck's notion of reflexive modernisation that we find much closer to our purposes of the analysis of disasters in LDCs. While it can lead to perpetual anxiety and the self-defeating approach of ecological modernisation discussed above, reflexive modernisation can result in more focused political demands on authorities to address what we could call the 'root causes' of vulnerability." (Wisner et al 2004:28)"Moving across the continuum, there are what could be termed 'weak constructionist' approaches, where risk is an objective hazard but is always mediated through social and cultural processes (Oliver-Smith and Hoffman 1999)." (Wisner et al 2004:29)"This book broadly takes a realist, and at times a weak constructionist, approach to risk." (Wisner et al 2004:29)"better theoretical understanding of disasters are possible only if one places the phenomenon of disaster 'in the mainstream' of policy and practice. Hewitt made this point twenty years ago when he wrote of how disasters had been mentally exiled to an 'archipelago' of exceptionalism (Hewitt 1983b)" (Wisner et al 2004:30)"In 1998, hurricane Mitch struck several Central American countries and made it obvious that it was underlying processes of land degradation and de-vegetation that made people vulnerable (see Chapter 7)." (Wisner et al 2004:32)"The death toll from this hurricane is estimated to have been 27,000 people, most of these in Honduras and Nicaragua. The majority of these deaths were from floods and landslides that could have been prevented if so much of these countries had not been stripped of their forest cover."

(Wisner et al 2004:36)"Although in 1998 the UNDP was able to conclude that, on average, health had improved in the previous 30 years (UNDP 1998: 21\textendash 23), in many African countries this was certainly not the" (Wisner et al 2004:36)"Typically the most underreported humanitarian crises listed by M\'edecins Sans Fronti\`eres (MSF) for 2001 tend to be slow onset, long-term disasters, most often linked to war or post-war situations." (Wisner et al 2004:38)"The Pressure and Release (PAR) model and the Household Access model, originally presented in the first edition of At Risk and re-introduced in an improved format in this edition," (Wisner et al 2004:41)"Poverty is not synonymous with vulnerability." (Wisner et al 2004:42)"While all of these are components of people's vulnerability, a building should be regarded as unsafe, rather than vulnerable; a settlement's location is hazardous, not vulnerable." (Wisner et al 2004:65)"Limits to our knowledge Vulnerability can be assessed reasonably precisely for a specific group of people living and working at a specific time and place, and the 'unsafe conditions' that contribute to it have been the subject of a great deal of research reviewed in this book. In much of the world, detailed knowledge has been obtained about which sites might be affected in a landslide, which buildings will survive or collapse in an earthquake and why, or about the outcomes of drought in terms of food production and possible shortfalls." (Wisner et al 2004:70)"However , as we move up the chain of explanation from unsafe conditions to root causes, the linkages (and therefore the level of precision in disaster explanation) become less definite." (Wisner et al 2004:71)"How good are disaster statistics?" (Wisner et al 2004:75)"In some countries, or regions of a country, even in 'normal' times there may be poor coverage of vital statistics, with many births and deaths going unrecorded." (Wisner et al 2004:76)"Others are never found, and are 'missing', but are never recorded as 'dead'," (Wisner et al 2004:76)"Thirdly, there can be political pressures either to overstate or to understate casualties." (Wisner et al 2004:76)"'[W]ith economic effects it' s difficult to assess which changes are caused by the disaster and which would have happened anyway . That is, there's always the problem that it' s easier to compare before and after the disaster , but what we really should be comparing is with and without the disaster'." (Wisner et al 2004:76)"difficult to object to the idea that population growth is a significant global pressure contributing to increasing vulnerability, and yet the linkages remain uncharted except in rather simplistic terms (e.g. there are more people, therefore some have to live in dangerous places). There are difficulties in trying to explain demographic change more carefully . For instance, there is considerable debate about whether population growth is a cause or a consequence of poverty in LDCs" (Wisner et al 2004:77)"The apparently illogical behaviour of people who seem to have too many children in hazardous places can be seen to be more logical (if no less risky) in the context of the Access model used in Chapter 3." (Wisner et al 2004:77)"As a dynamic pressure, population growth does not seem to us as important as change and age structure (see Box 2.4). In southern Africa as a result of the HIV-AIDS epidemic life expectancy and growth rates are falling, not increasing. This instability in population change is causing severe dislocation in the rural economy and complicating recovery from the drought of 2001\textendash 2002." (Wisner et al 2004:78)"At the other end of the age spectrum there is also a growing challenge posed by the ageing populations of Japan, North America and Europe." (Wisner et al 2004:78)"specific risk-reduction policies will be needed to focus on the protection of the elderly" (Wisner et al 2004:78)stopped reading this very intersting section on distal risks around here (note on p.82)"the PAR model does not provide a detailed and theoretically informed analysis of the precise interactions of environment and society at the 'pressure point', at the point where and when the disaster starts to unfold" (Wisner et al 2004:97)"Households earn their livelihoods in normal times (Box 1), and are subject to unsafe conditions (Box 2) and the political economy in which they all live is also shaped by social relations and structures of domination (Boxes 1a and 1b)." (Wisner et al 2004:100)"." (Wisner et al 2004:100)"It must be noted here that some disasters occur without a clear-cut, single, natural hazard trigger , nor perhaps with an identifiable event in the political economy . Instead, there are multiple contributing events which together constitute a 'complex emergency', which then unfolds in all its intractable complexity over a long period of time. An example is the situation in 2001\textendash 2003 in Zimbabwe, which has gone from a country producing a surplus of food into one facing bankruptcy and impending famine, in a complex mix of drought and political conflict." (Wisner et al 2004:101)"The PAR model, which forms a 'chain of explanation', is an analytical tool, subject to a number of inadequacies which we have tried to illustrate. One of its weaknesses is that the generation of vulnerability is not" (Wisner et al 2004:101)"adequately integrated with the way in which hazards themselves affect people; it is a static model. It exaggerates the separation of the hazard from social processes in order to emphasise the social causation of disasters." (Wisner et al 2004:102)"In this Access model, the political economy is modelled in two related systems. The first is called social relations (Figure 3.1, Box 1a) and encompasses the flows of goods, money and surplus between different actors (for example, merchants, urban rentiers, capitalist producers of food, rural and urban households involved in various relations of production and endowed with a particular range and quality of access to resources, called an access profile [see below])" (Wisner et al 2004:104)"The second system is termed structures of domination (Figure 3.1, Box 1b), and refers to the politics of relations between people at different levels.

reputation of earthquakes, epidemics and famine, a much greater proportion
of the world's population find their lives shortened by events that often
go unnoticed: violent conflict, illnesses, and hunger \textendash{} events that pass
for normal existence in many parts of the world, especially (but not only)
in less developed countries (LDCs)" (Wisner et al 2004:13)"But to focus on
these (in the understandably humanitarian way that outsiders do in
response to such tragedies) is to ignore the millions who are not killed
in such events, but who nevertheless face grave risks. Many more lives are
lost in violent conflict and to the preventable outcome of disease and
hunger (see Tables 1.1 and 1.2).2" (Wisner et al 2004:13)"e" (Wisner et al
2004:14)"However, we feel this book is justified, despite this rather
artificial separation between people at risk from natural hazards and the
many dangers inherent in 'normal' life." (Wisner et al 2004:14)"The
crucial point about understanding why disasters happen is that it is not
only natural events that cause them. They are also the product of social,
political and economic environments (as distinct from the natural
environment), because of the way these structure the lives of different
groups of people (see Box 1.1)." (Wisner et al 2004:14)"These two aspects
\textendash{} the natural and the social \textendash{} cannot be separated from each other:"
(Wisner et al 2004:15)"especially in LDCs, vulnerable people often suffer
repeated, multiple, mutually reinforcing, and sometimes simultaneous
shocks to their families," (Wisner et al 2004:15)"The 1990s was the UN
International Decade of Natural Disaster Reduction" (Wisner et al
2004:16)"This book is focused mainly on redressing the balance in
assessing the 'causes' of such disasters away from the dominant view that
natural processes are the most significant." (Wisner et al 2004:17)great
diagram (note on p.18)"In Guatemala, after the 1976 earthquake, the
situation deteriorated, with years of civil war and genocide against the
rural Mayan majority that only ended in 1996. During this period, hundreds
of thousands of Mayans were herded into new settlements by government
soldiers, while others took refuge in remote, forested mountains and still
others fled to refugee camps in Mexico. These population movements often
saw marginal people forced into marginal, dangerous places." (Wisner et al
2004:19)"1970s and early 1980s, the vulnerability approach to disasters
began with a rejection of the assumption that disasters are 'caused' in
any simple way by external natural events," (Wisner et al 2004:20)"A
competing vulnerability framework arose from the experience of research in
situations where 'normal' daily life was itself difficult to distinguish
from disaster." (Wisner et al 2004:20)"One approach was unapologetically
naturalist" (Wisner et al 2004:20)"Other views of 'man [sic] and nature'
(e.g. Burton et al. 1978; Whittow 1980) involved a more subtle
environmental determinism," (Wisner et al 2004:20)"It was assumed that
'progress' and 'modernisation' were taking place, and that 'folk' and
'mixed' societies would become 'industrial'," (Wisner et al 2004:21)"The
1970s saw increasing attempts to use 'political economy' to counter
modernisation theory and its triumphalist outlook" (Wisner et al
2004:21)"We avoid notions of vulnerability that do no more than identify
it with 'poverty'" (Wisner et al 2004:21)"We also reject those definitions
of vulnerability that focus exclusively on the ability of a system to cope
with risk or loss.12" (Wisner et al 2004:21)"By vulnerability we mean the
characteristics of a person or group and their situation that influence
their capacity to anticipate, cope with, resist and recover from the
impact of a natural hazard (an extreme natural event or process)" (Wisner
et al 2004:21)"When used in this sense, the implied opposite of being
vulnerable is sometimes indicated by our use of the term 'secure'.13 Other
authors complement the discussions of vulnerability with the notion of
'capacity'" (Wisner et al 2004:22)"vulnerability has a time dimension
built into it: vulnerability can be measured in terms of the damage to
future livelihoods, and not just as what happens to life and property at
the time of the hazard event." (Wisner et al 2004:22)"livelihood' is
important in the definition. We mean by this the command an individual,
family or other social group has over an income and/or bundles of
resources that can be used or exchanged to satisfy its needs." (Wisner et
al 2004:22)"The Access model analyses the ability of people to deal with
the impact of the hazards they face" (Wisner et al 2004:22)"in terms of
what level of access they have (or do not have) to the resources needed
for their livelihoods before and after a hazard's impact" (Wisner et al
2004:22)"Although vulnerability cannot be read directly off from poverty,
the two are often very highly correlated." (Wisner et al 2004:22)"There
are three important differences, however , between the vulnerability of
the rich and the poor in such cases" (Wisner et al 2004:22)"Firstly, few
rich people are affected if we compare the number of victims of landslides
in various cities around the world." (Wisner et al 2004:22)"Secondly,
living in the hazardous canyon environment is a choice made by some of the
rich in California, but not by the poor Brazilian or Philippine job
seekers" (Wisner et al 2004:23)"Thirdly, the consequences of a landslide
for the rich are far less severe than for the surviving poor." (Wisner et
al 2004:23)"in danger of showing people as passive and incapable of
bringing about change." (Wisner et al 2004:24)"now more interest in trying
to quantify vulnerability as a tool of planning and policy making" (Wisner
et al 2004:24)"Thus, the conversion of risk is turned into a common
metric, which enables different hazards to be compared (Rosa 1998), and
this is the main analytical route taken by this book. Disaster impact is
measured by a range of etic (external) and objectively verifiable
indicators, such as mortality, morbidity, damage to property and physical
assets, reduction in savings and so on." (Wisner et al 2004:24)"these
indicators are not sufficient, and we are aware that they tend to
under-emphasise the cultural, the psychosomatic and subjective aspects of
disaster impact" (Wisner et al 2004:24)"drawing down of different
'capitals' and the conversion of one to another" (Wisner et al
2004:25)"offers a more holistic view of well-being and decision making,
particularly under conditions of 'normal' life, and this is a contemporary
development of disaster theory which we elaborate on at length in Chapter
3." (Wisner et al 2004:25)"However , even this approach tends to make many
untested and simplistic assumptions about preferences, choices and values,
particularly under conditions of acute stress and extraordinary
circumstances." (Wisner et al 2004:25)"Fourthly, overlapping with the
previous point, there is a movement away from simple taxonomies or
checklists of 'vulnerable groups' to a concern with 'vulnerable
situations', which people move into and out of over time." (Wisner et al
2004:25)"'Vulnerability', as we use the word, refers only to people, not
to buildings (susceptible, unsafe), economies (fragile), nor unstable
slopes (hazardous) or regions of the earth's surface (hazard-prone)."
(Wisner et al 2004:25)"Special interest non-governmental organisations
(NGOs) have produced detailed checklists to take account of the particular
needs and vulnerabilities of such groups as elderly people or
unaccompanied children, both in vulnerability/capacity assessments as well
as post-disaster needs assessments (see Chapter 9). These post-disaster
tools are very useful as aides m\'emoires for busy administrators and case
workers" (Wisner et al 2004:25)"But the use of post-disaster checklists
does not in itself help one to understand why and how those
characteristics have come to be associated with a higher probability of
injury, death, livelihood disruption and greater difficulty in recovery"

correlation does not explain the process that gave rise to the association

vulnerability, but gender in a specific situation." (Wisner et al
2004:26)"There is a large and growing literature on risk that we
acknowledge but do not directly engage with in this book. The main reason
is that it focuses primarily on technological hazards" (Wisner et al
2004:26)"One influential author writing about risk during the 1980s and
1990s is Ulrich Beck. His books Risk Society: Toward a New Modernity?
(1992) and Ecological Politics in the Age of Risk (1995)," (Wisner et al
2004:26)"Beck maintains that the more developed world is in a transitional
state between industrial society and 'risk society': with so much wealth
also come risks." (Wisner et al 2004:27)"Thus, industrial, affluent
society is increasingly protected against the uncertainties faced in LDCs
through the application of technology and higher levels of income. Yet it
is none the less increasingly preoccupied with incalculable and diffuse
risks," (Wisner et al 2004:27)"use of Beck's notion of reflexive
modernisation that we find much closer to our purposes of the analysis of
disasters in LDCs. While it can lead to perpetual anxiety and the
self-defeating approach of ecological modernisation discussed above,
reflexive modernisation can result in more focused political demands on
authorities to address what we could call the 'root causes' of
vulnerability." (Wisner et al 2004:28)"Moving across the continuum, there
are what could be termed 'weak constructionist' approaches, where risk is
an objective hazard but is always mediated through social and cultural
processes (Oliver-Smith and Hoffman 1999)." (Wisner et al 2004:29)"This
book broadly takes a realist, and at times a weak constructionist,
approach to risk." (Wisner et al 2004:29)"better theoretical understanding
of disasters are possible only if one places the phenomenon of disaster
'in the mainstream' of policy and practice. Hewitt made this point twenty
years ago when he wrote of how disasters had been mentally exiled to an
'archipelago' of exceptionalism (Hewitt 1983b)" (Wisner et al 2004:30)"In
1998, hurricane Mitch struck several Central American countries and made
it obvious that it was underlying processes of land degradation and
de-vegetation that made people vulnerable (see Chapter 7)." (Wisner et al
2004:32)"The death toll from this hurricane is estimated to have been
27,000 people, most of these in Honduras and Nicaragua. The majority of
these deaths were from floods and landslides that could have been
prevented if so much of these countries had not been stripped of their
forest cover." (Wisner et al 2004:32)"In 2002, the Johannesburg World
Summit on Sustainable Development reaffirmed the place of disaster risk
reduction within its notion of 'sustainable development'." (Wisner et al
2004:32)"'vulnerability gap', 'which is widening within society," (Wisner
et al 2004:32)"The HDI again turns out to be the best predictor of deaths
triggered by extreme natural events." (Wisner et al 2004:36)"Although in
1998 the UNDP was able to conclude that, on average, health had improved
in the previous 30 years (UNDP 1998: 21\textendash 23), in many African countries
this was certainly not the" (Wisner et al 2004:36)"Typically the most
underreported humanitarian crises listed by M\'edecins Sans Fronti\`eres (MSF)
for 2001 tend to be slow onset, long-term disasters, most often linked to
war or post-war situations." (Wisner et al 2004:38)"The Pressure and
Release (PAR) model and the Household Access model, originally presented
in the first edition of At Risk and re-introduced in an improved format in
this edition," (Wisner et al 2004:41)"Poverty is not synonymous with
vulnerability." (Wisner et al 2004:42)"While all of these are components
of people's vulnerability, a building should be regarded as unsafe, rather
than vulnerable; a settlement's location is hazardous, not vulnerable."
(Wisner et al 2004:65)"Limits to our knowledge Vulnerability can be
assessed reasonably precisely for a specific group of people living and
working at a specific time and place, and the 'unsafe conditions' that
contribute to it have been the subject of a great deal of research
reviewed in this book. In much of the world, detailed knowledge has been
obtained about which sites might be affected in a landslide, which
buildings will survive or collapse in an earthquake and why, or about the
outcomes of drought in terms of food production and possible shortfalls."
(Wisner et al 2004:70)"However , as we move up the chain of explanation
from unsafe conditions to root causes, the linkages (and therefore the
level of precision in disaster explanation) become less definite." (Wisner
et al 2004:71)"How good are disaster statistics?" (Wisner et al
2004:75)"In some countries, or regions of a country, even in 'normal'
times there may be poor coverage of vital statistics, with many births and
deaths going unrecorded." (Wisner et al 2004:76)"Others are never found,
and are 'missing', but are never recorded as 'dead'," (Wisner et al
2004:76)"Thirdly, there can be political pressures either to overstate or
to understate casualties." (Wisner et al 2004:76)"'[W]ith economic effects
it' s difficult to assess which changes are caused by the disaster and
which would have happened anyway . That is, there's always the problem
that it' s easier to compare before and after the disaster , but what we
really should be comparing is with and without the disaster'." (Wisner et
al 2004:76)"difficult to object to the idea that population growth is a
significant global pressure contributing to increasing vulnerability, and
yet the linkages remain uncharted except in rather simplistic terms (e.g.
there are more people, therefore some have to live in dangerous places).
There are difficulties in trying to explain demographic change more
carefully . For instance, there is considerable debate about whether
population growth is a cause or a consequence of poverty in LDCs" (Wisner
et al 2004:77)"The apparently illogical behaviour of people who seem to
have too many children in hazardous places can be seen to be more logical
(if no less risky) in the context of the Access model used in Chapter 3."
(Wisner et al 2004:77)"As a dynamic pressure, population growth does not
seem to us as important as change and age structure (see Box 2.4). In
southern Africa as a result of the HIV-AIDS epidemic life expectancy and
growth rates are falling, not increasing. This instability in population
change is causing severe dislocation in the rural economy and complicating
recovery from the drought of 2001\textendash 2002." (Wisner et al 2004:78)"At the
other end of the age spectrum there is also a growing challenge posed by
the ageing populations of Japan, North America and Europe." (Wisner et al
2004:78)"specific risk-reduction policies will be needed to focus on the
protection of the elderly" (Wisner et al 2004:78)stopped reading this very
intersting section on distal risks around here (note on p.82)"the PAR
model does not provide a detailed and theoretically informed analysis of
the precise interactions of environment and society at the 'pressure
point', at the point where and when the disaster starts to unfold" (Wisner
et al 2004:97)"Households earn their livelihoods in normal times (Box 1),
and are subject to unsafe conditions (Box 2) and the political economy in
which they all live is also shaped by social relations and structures of
domination (Boxes 1a and 1b)." (Wisner et al 2004:100)"." (Wisner et al
2004:100)"It must be noted here that some disasters occur without a
clear-cut, single, natural hazard trigger , nor perhaps with an
identifiable event in the political economy . Instead, there are multiple
contributing events which together constitute a 'complex emergency', which
then unfolds in all its intractable complexity over a long period of time.
An example is the situation in 2001\textendash 2003 in Zimbabwe, which has gone from
a country producing a surplus of food into one facing bankruptcy and
impending famine, in a complex mix of drought and political conflict."
(Wisner et al 2004:101)"The PAR model, which forms a 'chain of
explanation', is an analytical tool, subject to a number of inadequacies
which we have tried to illustrate. One of its weaknesses is that the
generation of vulnerability is not" (Wisner et al 2004:101)"adequately
integrated with the way in which hazards themselves affect people; it is a
static model. It exaggerates the separation of the hazard from social
processes in order to emphasise the social causation of disasters."
(Wisner et al 2004:102)"In this Access model, the political economy is
modelled in two related systems. The first is called social relations
(Figure 3.1, Box 1a) and encompasses the flows of goods, money and surplus
between different actors (for example, merchants, urban rentiers,
capitalist producers of food, rural and urban households involved in
various relations of production and endowed with a particular range and
quality of access to resources, called an access profile [see below])"
(Wisner et al 2004:104)"The second system is termed structures of
domination (Figure 3.1, Box 1b), and refers to the politics of relations
between people at different levels. These include relations within the
household, between men and women, children and adults, seniors and
juniors." (Wisner et al 2004:104)"The structures of domination also
include the wider family and kinship ties of reciprocity and obligation at
a more extended (and usually less intensive) level, and those between
classes that are defined economically (such as employer and worker, patron
and client) and between members of different ethnic groups." (Wisner et al
2004:104)"Livelihood analysis seeks to explain how a person obtains a
livelihood by drawing upon and combining five types of 'capital', which
are similar to the assets that are involved in our Access model: 1 human
capital (skills, knowledge, health and energy); 2 social capital
(networks, groups, institutions); 3 physical capital (infrastructure,
technology and equipment); 4 financial capital (savings, credit); 5
natural capital (natural resources, land, water, fauna and flora)."
(Wisner et al 2004:106)"The Access model remains in this edition an
economistic model, which can be as precise, deterministic and quantitative
as the user wishes." (Wisner et al 2004:106)"The root causes, dynamic
pressures and unsafe conditions which the PAR framework deals with are
treated as qualitative inputs into the Access model and have to be
specified in more detail through the dynamic operation of structures of
domination and social relations." (Wisner et al 2004:106)"Each household
makes choices, within constraints, to take up one or more livelihoods or
income opportunities" (Wisner et al 2004:109)"income opportunity has a set
of access qualifications (Box 3b" (Wisner et al 2004:110)"Access to all
the resources that each individual or household possesses can collectively
be called its access profile" (Wisner et al 2004:110)"What is of more
immediate and specific importance are the structures of domination and
social relations at the local level (Boxes 1 and 4 in Figure 3.2), or the
'rules of the political economic game' for the microcosm of households
selected in this model. Between individuals within a household, these
involve the allocation of food, who eats first, who will have to absorb
consumption cut-backs in times of dearth or who receives medical
treatment. Gender politics within the household are of great importance
here," (Wisner et al 2004:112)"women and children sometimes bear the brunt
of disasters because of the power of male members of the household to

  abstract = {Previous studies have noted a proliferation of disparate theories of entrepreneurship. This makes it difficult to find the best theory for application in teaching, practice, and research. Choosing the right entrepreneurship theories to teach and encourage is critical to providing entrepreneurs with the knowledge they need to succeed. Scholars have recommended integrating entrepreneurship theories across disciplines and across practice; however, rigorous methods to assess and integrate the best theories are lacking. Integrative propositional analysis is an emerging method to assess and improve theories using the theory structure as data, rather than relying on empirical data and opinion alone. This exploratory study pilot tested this approach with a sample of nine entrepreneurship theories. Several insights emerged that entrepreneurship researchers, educators, and practitioners can use to synthesize and improve theories for their specific needs and to collaboratively integrate the best theories from research and experience to create better theories.},

Despite numerous national frameworks and agenda-setting documents to coordinate prevention efforts, Australia, like many countries internationally, is yet to substantively impact the burden from chronic disease. Improved evidence on effective strategies for the prevention of chronic disease is required. This research sought to articulate a priority set of important and feasible action domains to inform future discussion and debate regarding priority areas for chronic disease prevention policy and strategy. Methods: Using concept mapping, a mixed-methods approach to making use of the best available tacit knowledge of recognised, diverse and well-experienced actors, and national actions to improve the prevention of chronic disease in Australia were identified and then mapped. Participants (ranging from 58 to 78 in the various stages of the research) included a national sample of academics, policymakers and practitioners. Data collection involved the generation and sorting of statements by participants. A series of visual representations of the data were then developed. Results: A total of 95 statements were distilled into 12 clusters for action, namely Inter-Sectoral Partnerships; Systems Perspective/Action; Governance; Roles and Responsibilities; Evidence, Feedback and Learning; Funding and Incentive; Creating Demand; Primary Prevention; Social Determinants and Equity; Healthy Environments; Food and Nutrition; and Regulation and Policy. Specific areas for more immediate national action included refocusing the health system to prevention over cure, raising the profile of public health with health decision-makers, funding policy- and practice-relevant research, improving communication about prevention, learning from both global best-practice and domestic successes and failures, increasing the focus on primary prevention, and developing a long-term prevention strategy with an explicit funding commitment. Conclusions: Preventing chronic diseases and their risk factors will require at-scale, multi-component, multi-stakeholder action and cooperation. The concept mapping procedures used in this research have enabled the synthesis of views across different stakeholders, bringing both divergent and convergent perspectives to light, and collectively creating signals for where to prioritise national action.

  abstract = {As an essential component of human cognition, cause-effect relations appear frequently in text, and curating cause-effect relations from text helps in building causal networks for predictive tasks. Existing causality extraction techniques include knowledge-based, statistical machine learning(ML)-based, and deep learning-based approaches. Each method has its advantages and weaknesses. For example, knowledge-based methods are understandable but require extensive manual domain knowledge and have poor cross-domain applicability. Statistical machine learning methods are more automated because of natural language processing (NLP) toolkits. However, feature engineering is labor-intensive, and toolkits may lead to error propagation. In the past few years, deep learning techniques attract substantial attention from NLP researchers because of its' powerful representation learning ability and the rapid increase in computational resources. Their limitations include high computational costs and a lack of adequate annotated training data. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of causality extraction. We initially introduce primary forms existing in the causality extraction: explicit intra-sentential causality, implicit causality, and inter-sentential causality. Next, we list benchmark datasets and modeling assessment methods for causal relation extraction. Then, we present a structured overview of the three techniques with their representative systems. Lastly, we highlight existing open challenges with their potential directions.},

The theoretical background to the approach is multimethodology, in line with Minger's description of paradigm crossing and is appropriately situated within the Appreciate and Analyse phases of PSM intervention. The practical use of this method has been explored and three case studies are presented from the domains of organisational change and entrepreneurial studies. The value of this method is twofold; (i) it has the potential to improve dynamic sensibility in the process of qualitative data analysis, and (ii) it can provide a more rigorous approach to developing CLDs in the formation stage of system dynamics modelling. We propose that the further development of this method requires its implementation within CAQDAS packages so that CLD creation, as a precursor to full system dynamics modelling, is contemporaneous with coding and consistent with a bridging strategy of paradigm crossing. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {The approach described in this paper represents a substantive departure from the conventional quantitative techniques of system analysis. It has three main distinguishing features: 1) use of so-called ``linguistic'' variables in place of or in addition to numerical variables; 2) characterization of simple relations between variables by fuzzy conditional statements; and 3) characterization of complex relations by fuzzy algorithms. A linguistic variable is defined as a variable whose values are sentences in a natural or artificial language. Thus, if tall, not tall, very tall, very very tall, etc. are values of height, then height is a linguistic variable. Fuzzy conditional statements are expressions of the form IF A THEN B, where A and B have fuzzy meaning, e.g., IF x is small THEN y is large, where small and large are viewed as labels of fuzzy sets. A fuzzy algorithm is an ordered sequence of instructions which may contain fuzzy assignment and conditional statements, e.g., x = very small, IF x is small THEN Y is large. The execution of such instructions is governed by the compositional rule of inference and the rule of the preponderant alternative. By relying on the use of linguistic variables and fuzzy algorithms, the approach provides an approximate and yet effective means of describing the behavior of systems which are too complex or too ill-defined to admit of precise mathematical analysis.},

Moreover, it has dominated the processtracing modules at the Institute for Qualitative and Multi-Method Research (IQMR) and the American Political Science Association (APSA) meetings for over five years, rendering its impact even greater. Proponents of qualitative Bayesianism make a series of strong claims about its contributions and scope of inferential validity. Four claims stand out: ( ) it enables causal inference from iterative research, ( ) the sequence in which we evaluate evidence is irrelevant to inference, ( ) it enables scholars to fully engage rival explanations, and ( ) it prevents ad hoc hypothesizing and confirmation bias. Notwithstanding the stakes of these claims and breadth of traction this method has received, no one has systematically evaluated the promises, tradeo s, and limitations that accompany Bayesian process tracing. This article evaluates the extent to which the method lives up to the mission. Despite o ering a useful framework for conducting iterative research, the current state of the method introduces more bias than it corrects for on numerous dimensions. The article concludes with an examination of the opportunity costs of learning Bayesian process tracing and a set of recommendations about how to push the field forward.},
