# Has someone shared a file with you?{#xinvite}

::: {.rmdcaution}

If someone has [shared a file](#xpermissions)  with, say, YOU@MAIL.COM, make sure you sign in with YOU@MAIL.COM as well.

:::



If they have [sent you a link](#xinvite) like https://causalmap.shinyapps.io/CausalMap2/?s=99 to a particular map (or table), click the link and you will be automatically taken to view the corresponding map (or table), providing they have given you the correct permissions. 

Alternatively If they have just asked you to log in at the app to explore a file name, say "project-x", log in and click on the dropdown list on the left-hand side and click on `project-x` to load it. If you can't find that file name, it means they haven't correctly shared it with the email address you logged in with.
