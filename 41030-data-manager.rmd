### Sources in statements table not in sources table:

You need to check your sources table to see that there is a row for each one of these IDs You have statements which are supposed to come from these sources but you need to add information about these sources. Fix this by [roundtripping](#xroundtripping):  simply fill in the missing `source_id`s.

### Links which seem to have quotes which are not actually contained in the corresponding statements:

Quotes associated with each link should always be verbatim sections of the original statements. Sometimes they can lose this association, for example if you accidentally edited a quote to make it different from the original statement. You should check these link IDs. **Fix this by clicking on the link ids**, or by searching for the corresponding IDs like this, and then edit the link by clicking the pink "`...`" at the end of the row:
