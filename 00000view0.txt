Analysing a file means 

- **applying different filters** to it, to focus on different parts of the entire causal map in order to answer different questions

- **viewing the results in different ways** by clicking on different tabs in the right hand side to view different kinds of graphical map and various [tables](https://guide.causalmap.app/all-the-tables.html). 

If you want to view / analyse a file, you will mostly:

- use the right-hand side of the app and the Dashboard
- view many statements at a time by clicking `Many` on the multiple statement selector (above). 
- start off by analysing the [example-file](https://app.causalmap.app/?story=example-file&filters=&tab=Interactive&subtab=&version=none&tabl=).
