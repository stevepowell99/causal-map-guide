How to manage your data, whether it is downloading, modifying or appending? These bulletpoints will direct you to the relevant sections later in this Guide.

##  How to... 

<details><summary>Upload new statements to a new project</summary>
Create an excel xlsx file, name the first worksheet 'statements', and name the first column 'text'. Now paste your statements into the first column, so that each row is one statement. Next <a href="https://guide.causalmap.app/import.html">upload</a> your excel file to the app, using the first (black) upload button. <a href="https://guide.causalmap.app/import.html#formatting-your-file-the-basics">Click here</a> for more information. 
</details>

<details><summary>Upload data from a Word document</summary>
The procedure is the same as above: Copy your text from the word document into an excel file, so that each row is one statement. <a href="https://guide.causalmap.app/import.html#uploading-from-word">Click here</a> for more information. 
</details>

<details><summary>Upload a causal map which just contains links (an "edge list") </summary>
Your data must be in an Excel xlsx file with a single tab called 'links', containing just two columns called `from_label` and `to_label` which contain the names of your factors. Next <a href="https://guide.causalmap.app/import.html">upload</a> your excel file to the app. <a href="https://guide.causalmap.app/importing-your-data-special-cases.html#importing-existing-causal-coding">Click here</a> for more information. 
</details>

<details><summary>Add new statements to an existing file where you have already done some coding</summary>
Just <a href="https://guide.causalmap.app/roundtripping.html#downloading-a-file">download</a> the file, add new rows in the statements tab, and <a href="https://guide.causalmap.app/import.html">upload</a> it again. 
</details>

<details><summary>Add new information about sources to a file you have already started coding</summary> If you previously only had the column `source_id` in your statements table, but you now want to add information about your sources: Create an Excel file with a single tab called `sources` with the correct source_ids (they match the unique source_ids in the statements table). Then <a href="https://guide.causalmap.app/import.html">upload</a> just this file, and all your other data including factors and links will be retained.</details>

<details><summary>Fix some of the data you already uploaded </summary> Time to do some  <a href="https://guide.causalmap.app/roundtripping.html#xroundtripping">"roundtripping"!</a> Just <a href="https://guide.causalmap.app/roundtripping.html#downloading-a-file">download</a> the file, fix the data in any of the tabs `factors`, ` links`,  `statements`,  `sources` or `questions`, and <a href="https://guide.causalmap.app/import.html">upload</a> it again. Don't *delete* any rows unless you know what you are doing. </details>

<details><summary>Upload data from a PDF</summary>
We have an <a href="https://causalmap.shinyapps.io/pdf2excel/">app</a> for that! Simply convert your PDF to excel and <a href="https://guide.causalmap.app/import.html">upload</a> this in the normal manner to the app. <a href="https://guide.causalmap.app/ximport.html#ximport2excel">Click here</a> for more information.
</details>

<details><summary>Upload data from a Google form, ODK or similar</summary>
Download the Google form as an excel document. You can edit the column headers to tell the app more about your data: add $ to the start of any column headers that you wnat to be treated as statements and # to any you wish to be treated as important additional information. Then click the green upload button in the top panel to upload this data. The app will read the first tab and will ignore other tabs. The app will recognise each row as one source. <a href=https://guide.causalmap.app/ximport.html#upload-summary"">Click here</a> for more information. 
</details>

<details><summary>Upload closed questions</summary>
Add information about closed questions to the sources tab as described <a href="https://guide.causalmap.app/importing-your-data-special-cases.html#uploading-closed-question-blocks">here</a>. The app will then recognise these questions as closed questions and feed them into the `closed questions` table in the Tables tab. The app will recode a fixed set of words into + positive, - negative and 0 neutral.
