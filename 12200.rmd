# Certainty and trust 

In causal maps, sometimes it is enough that your links simply mean that “Source S claims that this influences/influenced that”, but sometimes you need richer ways to capture the relationship between causal factors. 

- Certainty: Source S is certain, or not so certain, that C influences E.

- Trust: the analyst has reason to believe that this particular claim, or all claims from source S, is particularly trustworthy or untrustworthy.

In the Causal Map coding style, we record this information for each link using just one attribute: “Certainty”. 

In the simplest version of QuIP coding (Copestake et al., 2019) you don’t need to think about these concepts. Behind the scenes, the app records Certainty = 1 for each link, but you don’t ever need to see or think about that. In the Causal Map app, just code a link and everything “just works”, so you can either **skip this section**, or read it to understand how simple approaches fit into a more general framework.
