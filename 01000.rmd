## What is a causal map? What is causal mapping?

A **causal map** is a diagram, a graphical structure, in which nodes (which we call "factors") are joined by directed edges or arrows (which we call "links"), so that a link from factor C to factor E means that, in some sense, C causally influences E. Causal maps are used by many research and practitioner teams around the world in a range of disciplines, who employ a variety of methods to construct and interpret them. While one group of such methods is actually called “causal mapping”, there are many similar methods which go by a wide variety of names. 

At the same time, the term "**causal mapping**" is often used as a name for a specific kind of *data collection* method, along with suggestions for analysis. (However, it is possible to have a causal *map* without anyone having intentionally done any causal *mapping*, using information gathered for other purposes.) There are a vast variety of possibilities, with seemingly every author having their own suggestions, from individual interview (Ackermann & Eden, 2004) to reusing open-ended questionnaire questions (Jackson & Trochim, 2002). We distinguish two main kinds of causal mapping:

- Individual respondents are deliberately asked for information about causal links, for example via open questions at the end of a questionnaire or via a series of interviews in which people are directly asked questions of the form “what causes what?” or “what contributed to this event?” For example in QuIP, respondents are asked for causes of changes, and then for causes of the causes, etc. We call this **unmerged** causal mapping because the information from different sources is not yet merged into a single map. When analysing the data, we try to read what the different sources tell us, and bit by bit (“inductively”) try to identify the common elements in their narratives, such as “Health” and “Amount of exercise”. Different respondents will, of course, not always use exactly the same phrases and it is a really exciting and creative challenge to create and curate this list of causal factors: a special kind of *causal* qualitative data analysis. This is your job as causal mapping analyst. For example, if Mo says “Feeling good about the future is one thing that increases your wellbeing”, is this element “feeling good about the future” the same as “confidence in the future” which Sara mentioned? Should we encode them both as the same thing, and if so, what shall we call it? Positive view of future? Does that cover both cases? The Causal Map app is designed for this kind of causal mapping.


- A group of people are deliberately asked about causal links and this information is merged straight away into an overall picture, as a participatory process with the group (Penn & Barbrook-Johnson, 2019). We call this **merged** causal mapping because information from different sources is already combined into one map. The Causal Map app can be useful here too, but it is not its primary use case. 

## Generic terminology for qualitative causal mapping

We collect qualitative data in the form of **text**. 

**Coding** that textual data means **highlighting** pieces of text which express **causal links** (or **causal claims**) between two (or more) **causal factors**. To code a causal link we specify a causal factor at the beginning of the link (“**influence factor**”) and a causal factor at the end of the link (“**consequence factor**”). You create labels for the causal factors, e.g. Increased crop yields. Usually you will start to reuse these same factors to create new causal links as you continue coding.

Some causal claims can be coded as just a single link between two factors like this.

In the most basic case, a link means simply that C has some kind of causal influence over D; we could say it makes a **causal contribution** to D, or it **causally influences** D. 

Often we will code a causal claim as a chain like this. These chains are particularly important in QuIP, where we try to trace outcomes back to their drivers:

Sometimes claims are more complex; in general we can call each claim a **causal map** (or a “**sub-map**” to make clear that it is only part of a larger story).

In order to ease interpretation, with a few exceptions, factors should be labelled and understood in such a way that it makes sense to say “more of this” or “less of this” or “this happened” or “this didn’t happen”: we call these semi-quantitative factors. 

These factor names can optionally also include flags: fragments of text, for example, *(Farming).* These should be chosen so they are easy to search for and wouldn’t come up in another factor label to mean something different. General terms, such as *(Farming),* can be used to organise the factors into **themes**. Analysts can also use flags to mark factors associated with specific interventions or project inputs, for example the word “*Intervention*”, as well as to mark factors which are regarded (usually in conversation with the evaluation commissioner) as desirable outcomes, e.g. by using the word “*Outcome*”.  

 

**Causal factors** can also optionally be **nested** within one another. This means for example that it is possible to view **zoom out** to see just the higher-level factors, with their subsidiary factors ‘rolled up’ into them. 

Additional coding possibilities for advanced users (more about these later in the guide):

●    **Hashtag****:** you can use these to make any notes about the *links*, e.g. to note that a link mentions a particular topic or type of statement (e.g. #future) or is a link that you want to review later. Hashtags can use an actual hashtag, e.g. *#hashtag*, but don’t have to, e.g. *hashtag*.

●    **Memo****:** as is standard in qualitative social research, as an analyst you can make short memos of any type on each statement, as well as about each causal link, each factor and the project globally.

●    **Strength** and **actualisation** of the causal link.

 

A useful concept is that of a **bundle** of links, i.e. sets of links which are coterminal, i.e. between the same influence and consequence factors, usually mentioned in different statements by different sources. These can be shown separately or, with certain caveats, together, with a thicker line and/or marked with a label to show the number of links in the bundle. 

Each individual piece of text is called a **statement**, usually this is a sentence, a paragraph or a few paragraphs. Each statement has an ID; a number like 1, 2, 3 etc.

Each statement usually has **additional data** associated with it, e.g. respondent ID number, respondent age, question number. An additional data **field** like “age” usually has various **values**, e.g. 0-20, 21-30. 

We call the set of statements (and possibly the set of respondents etc.) which correspond to a particular value of a particular field a group, e.g. the group of women. 

Usually, statements come from a set of **sources**; in QuIP and in most other kinds of study these are usually *respondents* – individual people or individual focus groups – but in other contexts the statements come from a set of *documents*. Each source is usually associated with several documents. In the app, you can, for example, search for all the statements made by a particular respondent (in the app, the term “source” is used rather than the term “respondent”). 

 

## Formatting in this guide…

We display statements and quotes from them, respondents’ actual words, in quote marks:

“Thanks to the financial support, I can now go to school”

We display factor labels with underlines, like this:

<u>Able to go to school</u>

When we display whole coded causal claims which include an arrow, we don’t use the underlines:

Financial support ➜ Able to go to school
