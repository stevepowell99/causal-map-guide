# Creating a new file

You can create your own file by [copying the example file](#xown-copy) or by creating a new file. These files will then be added to the dropdown list in the top left-hand side.

If you want to [upload your own data into a new file](#ximport), first press the New File button and give your file a name.

Then you can upload causal mapping data (consisting of at least a set of statements to be coded) in the form of an [Excel file](#xuploading-and-updating) (.xls or .xlsx).
