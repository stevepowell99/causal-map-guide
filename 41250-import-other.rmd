# Uploading your data: special cases{#ximport-other}

## Uploading from other software

We are aware of the initiative to make qualitative coding software interoperable, [https://www.qdasoftware.org/products-project-exchange/](https://www.qdasoftware.org/products-project-exchange/). Causal Map has quite a different model and at the moment we don’t provide this, but would do if there is a lot of interest.

You can always export all your data at any time using the Download button in the [top menu](#xtop-menu).

If you have existing causal coding in the form of an "edge-list" you can upload it [like this](#xlinks-only).
