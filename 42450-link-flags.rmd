## Using memos and hashtags{#xmemosandhashtags}

### Memos{#xlink-memos}

Qualitative coding usually involves making notes and memos, and you can do this in Causal Map too.

This toggle opens both additional statement info, i.e. info for any fields which start with #, for example you might have a field #gender in your statements table, and also shows the boxes to edit the memos. (In this example, there is no additional information.)

### Link flags (aka Hashtags){#xhashtags}

(Link flags are also sometimes called hashtags. But there is no need to use a hash `#` at the start of a link flag, though you can if you want.)

Link flags are available as a special kind of memo when coding a link: you can use them to provide any kind of additional information.

As usual in Causal Map, you can apply one or more flags, and you can either select existing flags or create new ones on the fly.

Later, you can [filter the map](https://guide.causalmap.app/analysis.html#filtering-the-map-by-link-hashtag-memo) to show only links containing or beginning or ending with specific flags (or parts of flags), and also for links which do *not* contain specific flags or parts of flags.

Conceptually, there are two kinds:

#### Ordinary link flags

You can use any flag which does not begin with a `?` to record any other information about the link, e.g.:


  - respondent doesnâ€™t like this connection 
  - respondent feels good about the outcome
- for you, the analyst, e.g.
  - respondent is answering a different question 
  - to tag links you want to come back and review. 

#### ðŸ§ªWeak flags

Weak flags are a special kind of hashtag aka link flag. They are *caveats*. If you use weak flags, you should make sure that by default your maps do not include any link with a weak flag. 

They begin with `?` and are used to mark any link which you are not sure is always valid across the global context for the whole global map, for example:

- **the causal connection** is only valid for a specific context, e.g.
  
  - the respondent says this is only true for their village, not for other villages e.g. `?village X`
  - a link is only projected for the future e.g. `?future`
- you are unsure about **the claim about the causal connection**
  - a link is only a hypothesis e.g. `?hypothetical`
  - you as the analyst are not confident in the claim  e.g. `?doubtful`
  - the source themselves are not sure  e.g. `?source seems unsure`
  - to add other qualifying information  e.g. `?probably hearsay`
  


  - to mark the fact that a connection is **weak or non-existent**, e.g.

    - Respondent makes a substantive claim that X does *not* influence Y, e.g. `?zero influence`
    - Respondent makes a substantive claim that X only insignificantly influences Y, e.g. `?weak`


##### Weak flags in [quickfields](#xquickfields).

If you are using quickfields for (some of) your link flags, you can usually put the `?` at the start of the flag as normal:

`?context:village-A`

`?context:village-B`

However the "weakness" only applies to one of the values of the quickfield, in which case we recommend the following kind of format, in which the `?` comes before the second part of the flag:

`strength:?none`

`strength:strong`

or 

`confidence:?low`

`confidence:high`

This makes sense because in your default maps you would only want to exclude one, not both, of each of the pairs in these examples.
