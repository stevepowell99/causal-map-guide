# Collaborating at Causal Map

## Collaboration

At the moment, you can log in to the same or different maps from the same or different accounts, including from multiple browser tabs -- so you can have two maps open at once.

Two different people *can* edit the same file. However at the moment the results can be unpredictable and we recommend working asynchronously (taking it in turns.) If you are viewing a file while someone else edits it, you will have to refresh to see any changes they made. 

## Teams

- You can create one or more teams and make other people members of that team
- Other people can include you in their teams
- Each team has an owner and a name, and one or more members
- The names of teams you are a member of appear in sha
- There is a special team called `global`: sharing a file with `global` means that any user of Causal Map gets access.
