### Sources

What does this table show me?

The sample table [without any filters applied] simply lists all of the respondents and any additional data collected about them (sex, age, location, education.) It also shows the interview type (individual or focus group) for each source. When filters are applied, the table will only present the relevant sources/respondents. If you are searching and filtering for a specific factor, this table will update and only show sources who reported that factor.

Why would I use this table?

In the first instance, this table can be useful to check that all the sources have been imported into the app correctly. The table also provides a summary of the respondents which can be useful for presenting respondent demographics in the report, either in the sampling section or as an appendix.## Questions


### Questions

What does this table show me?

This table displays the text and ID for every question included in the questionnaire. It may also show any other additional data fields which are the same for each question, e.g. questionnaire subsection or question group.

Why would I use this table?

You may wish to include this table as an appendix in your report or as a reference point for looking up particular questions.

### Closed question blocks

There are two tables which provide a summary of the responses to the **closed questions** asked at the end of each QuIP questionnaire domain. The following symbols are used in the tables to represent the direction of change indicated by the response to the closed question:

| **Symbol** | **Direction  of change** | **Example  responses**          |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **0**      | No change                | “No change” “Stayed the same”   |
| **+**      | Positive change          | “Better” “Improved” “Increased” |
| **-**      | Negative change          | “Worse” “Decreased”             |



The closed questions table gives an overview of how each **individual** respondent answered each closed question. The closed question summary table presents the **total respondent counts** for each direction of change. For every closed question you can see how many respondents reported positive, negative, or no change in that domain. You may wish to search and filter the statements to view only the closed question responses from a particular respondent group. 

Why would I use this table?

These tables provide a snapshot of the overall trends of change across the domains, so they can be a helpful introduction and “easing in” to the findings - before diving deeper into the causal stories! The closed question responses can also provide interesting insights when compared to the open-ended responses, especially in cases where they might differ.
