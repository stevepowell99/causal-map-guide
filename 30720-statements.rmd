# The Statements Table {#xthe-statements-table}

This table makes searching for a specific statement easy. By clicking on a row in this table you will jump straight to the statement, meaning you can edit the associated factors in the left-hand-side panel. This table shows you all the statements in your map file. You can use the search bars to look for statements by their id or by a word/phrase in the text.

There are two presets for this table:

- `Statements (basic)` this will automatically load when you click on this tab and displays statement id, text, source_id and question id

- `Statements metadata` this preset gives you more information about who said which statement and shows you household code, name of province , village , age as well as the fields listed above. If your metadata fields are called something different just add them to the columns box to display them.

Remember the print view button may come in handy to view your table as plain text. ![image-20220921170450911](_assets/image-20220921170450911.png)
