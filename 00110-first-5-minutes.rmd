#  Your first 5 minutes with Causal Map{#x5}

When you first login, you will be able to see a number of files in the dropdown list on the left-hand side.

Some of these are standard template files everyone can see - so if you have simply been asked to log in to view a whole project, make sure you know the file name that you should be looking at. Alternatively, you may have been [sent a link](#xinvite) to a specific filtered map. 

Once you load a file you can see how data has been [coded](#xcoding-panel), look at transcripts using the ['book' buttons](#xstatement-nav), or create your own maps using the [filters](xintro-filters). Example 2 is a good place to start, it is the default file and so will already be loaded. You won't be able to change anything as you will have View Only access, but [take a look around](#quick-tour) and have a play with the [filters](#xintro-filters) and [tables](x#all-tables).

If you want to try out some coding yourself, why not [copy an example file](#xown-copy) or [upload your own](#ximport) and with the help of the [coding section](#xcoding-panel) of this guide give it a go?
