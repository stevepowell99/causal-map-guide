# Overview

## What is Causal Map?

[Causal Map](https://causalmap.app/) is a web app for analysing and visualising causal claims within narrative data from interviews or reports. 

```{r,echo=F}
knitr::include_url("https://player.vimeo.com/video/689223728")
```





If you are particularly interested in the *theory* of causal mapping, rather than how to use the app, look for the "book" symbol ðŸ“š in this Guide.

This Guide is divided into these Training Levels:

1. [Getting Started](#xlevel1)
2. [Basic Coding](#xlevel2)
3. [Basic Analysis](#xlevel3)
4. [Advanced Coding](#xlevel4)
5. [Advanced Analysis](#xlevel5)

Each is followed by a simple [quiz](https://causalmap.shinyapps.io/quizzes/). 

... and there are also sections on:

- [The rest of the app](#xupdates-tab) 
- [Technical reference](#xlevel7)
- [Frequently Asked Question](https://guide.causalmap.app/faqs.html)

If you are in a hurry (and who isn't?), just read Level 1: Getting Started.

Features marked ðŸ§ªare experimental and are implemented on the [test servers](https://causalmap.shinyapps.io/CM2test) [only](https://causalmap.shinyapps.io/tokyo).
