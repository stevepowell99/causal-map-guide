This Guide is for you if:

- you want to find out more about causal mapping as an approach (look for the "book" symbol ðŸ“š)
- you want to find out more about the [Causal Map app](https://causalmap.app/) (look for the "computer" symbol ðŸ’»)
- you are on, or have completed, the [QuIP](https://bathsdr.org/about-the-quip/) Lead Evaluator training.
