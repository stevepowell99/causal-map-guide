# Overview

## What is Causal Map?

Causal Map is a web app for analysing and visualising causal claims within narrative data from interviews or reports. 

```{r,echo=F}

knitr::include_url("https://player.vimeo.com/video/689223728")
```

This Guide is for you if:

- you want to find out more about causal mapping as an approach (look for the "book" symbol ðŸ“š).
- you want to find out how to use the [Causal Map app](https://causalmap.app/). 
- you are on, or have completed, the [QuIP](https://bathsdr.org/about-the-quip/) Lead Evaluator training.

------

This Guide is divided into these Training Levels:

1. [Getting Started](#xprerequisites)
2. [Basic Coding](#xstarting-coding)
3. [Basic Analysis](#xabout-filters)
4. [Advanced Coding](#xcollaboration)
5. [Advanced Analysis](#xtables-advanced)

... and there are also sections on:

- The rest of the app
- Technical reference

Each is followed by a simple [quiz](https://causalmap.shinyapps.io/quizzes/). 

If you are in a hurry (and who isn't?), just read Level 1: Getting Started.

Features marked ðŸ§ªare experimental and are implemented on the [test server](https://causalmap.shinyapps.io/CM2test) only.
