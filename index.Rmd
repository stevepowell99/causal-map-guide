# ‚ö° Overview

![img](_assets/simplify.png){width=650px}

This Guide is for you if:

- you want to find out more about causal mapping as an approach (look for this symbol üìö)
- you want to find out more about the [Causal Map app](https://causalmap.app/) (look for this symbol üíª)
- you are on, or have completed, the [QuIP](https://bathsdr.org/about-the-quip/) Lead Evaluator training

------

If you are in a hurry (and who isn't?), look for overview sections and subsections marked with a ‚ö°.

::: {.rmdnote}

This Guide accompanies Causal Map 2, the new version of Causal Map, and is valid from September 2021. 

The [old version of this Guide](http://guide2.causalmap.app.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/) covers the old version of Causal Map (the one hosted at go.causalmap.app).

## Formatting in this guide‚Ä¶

We display statements and quotes from them, respondents‚Äô actual words, in quote marks:

‚ÄúThanks to the financial support, I can now go to school‚Äù

We display factor labels with underlines, like this:

<u>Able to go to school</u>

When we display whole coded causal claims which include an arrow, we don‚Äôt use the underlines:

Financial support ‚ûú Able to go to school 

This first part of the Guide covers all the basic ideas of causal mapping. The second part covers some additional ideas, which correspond to the features enabled for those with "Extra" subscriptions to the Causal Map app.
