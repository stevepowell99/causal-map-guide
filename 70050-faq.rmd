##  **Coding**

<details><summary>When I highlight a single word or very short phrase, why is the same word highlighted but in a different part of the statement?</summary>
If you highlight a very short piece of text which happens to appear (exactly the same) more than once in the statement, it is always the **first** occurrence of this piece of text which is actually highlighted. 
</details>

<details><summary>Can I edit more than one link at a time?</summary>
No, currently you can only edit one link at a time.</details>

<details><summary>Can I autofill influence factor label if its the same as the last consequence factor?</summary>
Yes, that is called chaining links! You can chain links by clicking the chain icon, after you have saved your previous link. If you would like more guidance check out this <a href="https://causalmap.app/courses/causal-map-basics/lessons/how-to-code-a-link/">video</a>.</details>

<details><summary>I'm all zoomed out, how do I get a normal zoom level in my browser? </summary>If you have Windows press ctrl and 0. If you have a Mac press option, command and 0.</details>

<details><summary>Can I create more than one link at a time?</summary>
Yes. You can create multiple links at a time just by putting more than one factor in either or both boxes.If you want more information check out this <a href="https://causalmap.app/courses/causal-map-basics/lessons/how-to-code-a-link/">short video</a>.</details>

<details><summary>How do I link two existing chains?</summary>To link a chain a --> b --> c to a chain d --> e, highlight the part of the statement which provides the evidence and then code a link from c to d using the dropdowns as usual.</details>

<details><summary>If a respondent makes the same causal claim twice, should I code it twice?</summary>
If they are just repeating the same point, don't bother. But if they are bringing different evidence for the same link, code it twice.</details>  



## Known Bugs

<details><summary>When I highlight text which overlaps with a previously highlighted section no new highlight appears.</summary>
Unfortunately there is no easy fix for this bug but it is just cosmetic. You can check you have highlighted the right section by checking the text box below the factor label boxes contains the text you want to highlight. Once you have saved the link the highlight will appear on the statement.</details>


## QuIP questions

<details><summary>How do I import my QuIP project into Causal Map?</summary>
There isn't an official QuIP way but uploading/importing data into Causal Map should be pretty simple. It depends on how you have collected your data, for example from word files or ODK etc. There are basically two ways to upload your project but other variants are possible too.<p><b>1. Separate tables</b></p> The first table is uploaded/imported to the app as the main statements table and the other two tables can easily be added after that.<p><b>Table 1: statements</b></p> In the first approach you simply enter the text of each statement in a single column of a spreadsheet file with the heading "text". One row per statement. statement is usually round about a paragraph but it could be as short as a sentence or several paragraphs if that's convenient. then you'd usually have two more columns one for respondent ID and one for question ID. That means for each statement you know the respondent and the question.<p><b>Table 2: respondents</b></p>Then you usually have a second table giving more details of each respondent, for example gender.<p><b>Table 3: questions</b></p> This third table give you more details about each question, for example question text.<p><b>2.One big table</b></p>The second approach is to combine all of this information into a single table, which you just upload as the main statements table and that's it. In this approach any additional columns like gender or question text have to be added to the main table so they are quite repetitive. So if respondents 1 2 and 3 are all female and they have 20 statements each then you will see the word female 60 times in a column called "gender".</details>
